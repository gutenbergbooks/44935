<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>YSTERY, magic, and manitoes abound in the
land of Hiawatha, in the land of the Ojibwas,
among the green islands, graceful and beautiful,
lying amidst the dancing blue waters when the sun
shines over Gitche Gomee, the Great Water.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Manitoes,
great and mighty, lived in the cool depths of the
mighty forests, in the rivers and lakes, and even in the
snows of winter. And adventures there were in those
early days amongst these islands of the North, when
manitoes directed the affairs of men.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_1_1">[1]</a></span>
Gitche Gomee is Lake Superior.</p>
</div>

<p>But the animal fathers lived upon the earth before
there came the &ldquo;two-legged walkers.&rdquo; There were
many animals. There were many beavers. It was the
beavers who made Gitche Gomee, the Great Water.
They made it by building two dams. The first they
built at the Grand Sault, and the second was five leagues
below. When Great Hare came up the river, he said,
&ldquo;This must not be so.&rdquo; Therefore he stepped upon the
first dam. But he was in haste. He did not break it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vi]</a></span>
down; therefore there are now great falls and whirlpools
at that place. But at the second dam, Great Hare
stepped upon it mightily; therefore there are now few
falls and only a little swirling water at that place.
Great Hare was very mighty. When he chased Beaver
he stepped across a bay eight leagues wide.</p>

<p>Around Michilimackinack was the land of Great
Hare. There, amongst the green islets, under the cool
shade of wide spreading trees, where fish leaped above
the rippling waters, he made the first fish net. He
made it after watching Spider weave a web for catching
flies.</p>

<p>It was Wenibojo,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who, in Ojibwa land, discovered
the wild rice and taught the Indians to use it. He first
pointed out the low grassy islands in the lakes, waving
their bright green leaves and spikes of yellowish-green
blossoms. He showed them how to cut paths through
the wild rice beds before the grain was ripe, and later,
to beat it into their canoes. He told them always to
gather the wild rice before a storm, else the wind would
blow it all into the water. Therefore the Indians use
wild rice in all their feasts. They even taught the white
men to use it.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_2_2">[2]</a></span>
Wenibojo is only a variation of the name also given as Manabush.
Both are identical with Hiawatha.</p>
</div>

<p>When the snows of winter lay deep upon the forests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vii]</a></span>
of the North, when ice covered lakes and rivers, then
the story tellers of the Ojibwas, as of all other Indian
tribes, told the tales of the olden times, when manitoes
lived upon the earth, and when the animal fathers
roamed through the forest. But such stories are not
told in summer. All the woods and shores, all the bays
and islands, are, in summer, the home of keen-hearing
spirits, who like not to have Indians talking about them.
But when the deep snows come, then the spirits are
more drowsy. Then the Indians, when North West
rattles the flaps of the wigwams, and wild animals hide
in the shelter of the deep forest, tell their tales. All
winter they tell them, while the fires burn in the wigwams&mdash;tell
them until the frogs croak in the spring.</p>

<p>Tales they tell of how Gitche Manito, the Good One,
taught the Indians how to plant the Indian corn, how
to strip and bury Mondamin, and how to gather the
corn in the month of falling leaves, that there may be
food in the camps when the snows of winter come.
Tales they tell of Gitche Manedo, the Evil One, who
brings only distress and sickness&mdash;tales of the land of
Hiawatha. Mystery and magic lay all about them.</p>

<p>It is a far cry from the stories of the North along the
banks of the Mississippi, from that land of long winters,
through the country of the mound builders, to the
sunnier Southland; yet from north to south, around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>viii]</a></span>
the glimmering Indian fires, grouped eager men and
women and children, listening to the story tellers.</p>

<p>But quite different are the tales of the Southland&mdash;of
the Cherokees, Biloxis, and Chitimachas. They are
stories of wild turkeys, of persimmons and raccoons,
and of the spirits which dwell in the mountain places
where none dare go. Stories also are they of Brer
Rabbit and the tar wolf, which came from Indian
slaves working in the fields in early days, through the
negro slaves working beside them, to the children of
the white men.</p>


<p class="break">It is a loss to American literature that so much of
the legendary history of these Indian tribes has gone,
beyond hope of recovery. Exquisite in color, poetical
in feeling, these legends of sun, moon, and stars, of
snow, ice, lightning, thunders, the winds, the life of the
forest birds and animals about them, and the longing
to understand the why and the how of life&mdash;all which
we have only in fragments. Longfellow&rsquo;s work shows
the wonderful beauty of these northern legends, nor
has he done violence to any of them in making them
poetical. His picture of the departure of Hiawatha,
the lone figure standing stately and solemn, as the canoe
drifted out towards the glowing sunset, while from the
shore, in the shadow of the forest, came the low Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>ix]</a></span>
chant, mingling with the sighing of the pine trees, is
truely Indian. For the mystical and poetical is strong
in the Indian nature.</p>

<p>As in all the other volumes of this series, no effort
has been made to ornament or amplify these legends in
the effort to make them &ldquo;literary,&rdquo; or give them &ldquo;literary
charm.&rdquo; They must speak for themselves. What
editing has been done has been in simplifying them,
and freeing them from the verbose setting in which
many were found. For in this section of the country,
settled before it was realized that there was an Indian
literature, the original work of noting down the myths
was very imperfectly done.</p>

<p>Thanks are due to the work of Albert E. Jenks, on
the wild rice Indians of the upper lakes; to James
Mooney, for the myths of the Cherokees; to George
Catlin, for some of the upper Mississippi legends; to
the well-known but almost inaccessible work of Schoolcraft,
and to others.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE EARTH-MAKER</h2>

<p class="nation">Winnebago</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Earth-maker came to consciousness, he
thought of the substance upon which he was
sitting. He saw nothing. There was nothing
anywhere. Therefore his tears flowed. He wept.
But not long did he think of it. He took some of the
substance upon which he was sitting; so he made a little
piece of earth for our fathers. He cast this down from
the high place on which he sat. Then he looked at
what he had made. It had become something like our
earth. Nothing grew upon it. Bare it was, but not
quiet. It kept turning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How shall I make it become quiet?&rdquo; thought
Earth-maker. Then he took some grass from the
substance he was sitting upon and cast it down upon
the earth. Yet it was not quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
Then he made a man. When he had finished him,
he called him Tortoise. At the end of all his thinking,
after he came to consciousness, he made the two-legged
walkers.</p>

<p>Then Earth-maker said to this man, &ldquo;The evil
spirits are abroad to destroy all I have just created.
Tortoise, I shall send you to bring order into the
world.&rdquo; Then Earth-maker gave him a knife.</p>

<p>But when Tortoise came to earth, he began to make
war. He did not look after Earth-maker&rsquo;s creation.
So Earth-maker took him back.</p>

<p>Then he sent Hare down to earth to restore order.
He said, &ldquo;See, Grandmother, I have done the work my
father directed me to do. The lives of my uncles and
aunts, the two-legged walkers, will be endless like
mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His grandmother said, &ldquo;Grandson, how could you
make the lives of your uncles and aunts endless like
yours? How could you do something in a way Earth-maker
had not intended it to be? Earth-maker could
not make them thus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hare thought, &ldquo;My grandmother must be related to
some of the evil spirits I have killed. She does not
like what I have done, for she is saying that I killed
the evil spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now grandmother heard him think. &ldquo;No, Grandson,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
I am not thinking of that. I am saying that our
father made death so there should not be a lack of
food on earth. He made death to prevent overcrowding.
He also made a spirit world in which they
should live after death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hare did not like what she said. &ldquo;Grandmother
surely does not like it,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;She must be
related to the evil spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Grandson, it is not so. But to quiet you, your
uncle and aunts will live to be very old.&rdquo; Then she
spoke again, &ldquo;Now, Grandson, stand up. The two-legged
walkers shall follow me always. I shall follow
you always. Therefore try to do what I tell you.
Remember you are a man. Do not look back after
you have started.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they started to go around the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not look back,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder why she says that,&rdquo; thought Hare. Then
he turned his head the least little bit to the left, and
looked back to the place from which they had started.
Instantly everything caved in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my! Oh, my!&rdquo; exclaimed grandmother.
&ldquo;Grandson, a man you are; but I thought you were a
great man, so I greatly encouraged you. Now even if
I wished to, I could not prevent death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This she meant, so they say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
Then they went around the earth, to the edge of the
fire which encircles the earth. That way they went,
so they say.</p>

<h2>CREATION</h2>

<p class="nation">Chitimacha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was a Creator of All Things. This
Great Mystery understood all things. He
had no eyes, yet he could see. He had no
ears, yet he could hear. He had a body, but it could
not be seen.</p>

<p>When the earth was first made, the Creator of All
Things placed it under the water. The fish were first
created. But when the Creator wanted to make men,
there was no dry land. Therefore Crawfish was sent
down to bring up a little earth. He brought up mud
in his claws. Immediately it spread out and the earth
appeared above the waters. Then the Great Mystery
made men. He made the Chitimachas. It was at
Natchez that he first made them.</p>

<p>He gave them laws but the people did not follow
the laws. Therefore many troubles came, so that the
Creator could not rest. Therefore the Creator made
tobacco. Then men could become quiet and rest.
Afterwards he made women, but at first they were like
wood. So he directed a chief to teach them how to
move, and how to cook, and to sew skins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
Now when the animals met the Chitimachas, they
ridiculed them. For these men had no fur, and no
wool, and no feathers to protect them from storms, or
rain, or the hot sun. The Chitimachas were sad
because of this.</p>

<p>Then the Creator gave them bows and arrows, and
taught them how these things should be used. He told
them that the flesh of the animals was good for food,
and their skins for covering. Thus the animals were
punished.</p>

<p>The Creator taught them also how to draw fire from
two pieces of wood, one flat and the other pointed;
thus they learned to cook their food. The Creator
taught them also to honor the bones of their relatives;
and so long as they lived, to bring them food.</p>

<p>Now in those days, the animals took part in the
councils of men. They gave advice to men, being
wiser. Each animal took especial care of the
Chitimachas. Therefore the Indians respect the
animals which gave good advice to their ancestors,
and this aids them even today in time of need.</p>

<p>The Creator also made the moon and the stars.
Both were to give life and light to all things on earth.
Moon forgot the sacred bathing, therefore he is pale
and weak, giving but little light to man. But Sun
gives light to all things. Sun often stops on her trail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
to give more time to the Indians when they are hunting,
or fighting their enemies. Moon does not, but
always pursues his wife over the sky trail. Yet he can
never catch up with her.</p>

<p>The mounds in the Chitimacha country are the
camping places of the spirit sent down by the Creator
to visit the Indians. This spirit taught the men how
to cook their food and to cure their wounds. He is
still highly honored.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE CREATION</h2>

<p class="nation">Wyandot</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was, in olden days, something the
matter with the earth. It has changed. We
think so. We think the Great Mystery made
it and made men also. He made them at a place called
Mountains. It was eastward. When he had made
the earth and these mountains, he covered the earth
over with something. He did it with his hands.</p>

<p>Under this, he put men. All the different tribes were
there. One of the young men climbed up and found
his way to the surface. It was very beautiful. Then
a deer ran past, with an arrow in its side. He followed
it to where it fell and died. He looked back to see
its tracks, and he soon saw other tracks. They were the
footprints of the person who shot the deer. He soon
came up. It was the Maker of Men. Thus he taught
the Indians what they must do when they came out of
the earth. The creator showed the Indian how to skin
the deer, and prepare it for food, and how to use the
skin for dress.</p>

<p>When everything was ready, he said, &ldquo;Make a fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
The Indian said, &ldquo;I do not know how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therefore the creator made the fire. Then he said,
&ldquo;Put the meat on the fire. Roast it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Indian did this, but he did not turn the stick.
Therefore it was burned on one side and not roasted
on the other. So the creator showed him how to turn
the stick.</p>

<p>Then the Great Mystery called all the Indians up
out of the earth. They came out by tribes. To each
tribe he gave a chief. Then he made a head chief over
all the tribes, who should teach them what they
should do.</p>

<p>The Great Mystery also made Good and Evil. They
were brothers. One made pleasant things grow. The
other spent all his time spoiling his brother&rsquo;s work.
He made stony places, and rocks, and made bad fruits
to grow. He made great trouble among men. He
annoyed them very much. Good had to go back and
do his work over again. It kept him very busy. Then
Good decided to destroy Evil.</p>

<p>Therefore Good proposed to run a race with Evil.
When they met, Good said, &ldquo;Tell me first&mdash;what do
you most fear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bucks&rsquo; horns,&rdquo; said Evil. &ldquo;What do you most
fear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indian grass braided,&rdquo; said Good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
Then Evil at once went to his grandmother, who
braided Indian grass. He got a great deal of it. He
put the grass in the trail, and put it in the limbs of the
trees along the trail where Good was to run. Good
also filled the path, where his brother Evil was to run,
with bucks&rsquo; horns.</p>

<p>They said, &ldquo;Who shall run first?&rdquo; They argued
about it. At last Good said, &ldquo;Well, I will, because I
proposed the race.&rdquo; So he started off and Evil followed
him. When Good became tired, he pulled
down a strand of braided green grass and chewed it.
Thus he ran rapidly. But Evil became tired. Yet
Good would not stop until he reached the end of
the trail.</p>

<p>The next day Evil started on his trail. Everywhere
he was stopped by the branches of bucks&rsquo; horns. They
greatly annoyed him. He said to Good, &ldquo;Let me
stop.&rdquo; Good said, &ldquo;No, you must go on.&rdquo; At last,
towards evening, Evil fell in the trail. At once Good
took bucks&rsquo; horns and killed him.</p>

<p>Then Good returned to his grandmother. She was
very angry. She loved Evil. That night Good was
awakened by a sound. The spirit of Evil was talking
with his grandmother. Then when Evil knew Good
was awake, he said, &ldquo;Let me into the wigwam.&rdquo; But
Good always said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
At last Evil said, &ldquo;I go to the northwest land. You
will never see me more. Those who follow me will
never come back. Death will keep them.&rdquo;</p>

Obviously influenced by missionary teaching, but a most curious
myth.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">K</span>UTI MANKDCE, the One Above, made
people. He made one person, an Indian.
While the Indian was sleeping, he made a
woman. Then the One Above went away to find food
for the man and woman.</p>

<p>After he left, something was standing there upright.
It was a tree. A person said, &ldquo;Why do you not eat
the fruit of this tree? I think he made it for you
to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the woman pulled off some fruit and stewed it
and she and the Indian ate it. Shortly after, the One
Above returned. Now he had gone away to find food
for them. When he found they had stewed this fruit,
he was very angry. He said, &ldquo;Work for yourself.
Find your own food, else you shall be hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the One Above had been a long time gone,
he sent back a letter to the Indians. But the Indians
did not receive it, because the Americans took it. That
is why Americans know how to read and write.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
Now after the letter came, the people found a very
clear stream of water. The American found it first
and lay down in it; therefore he is very white all over.
Next came the Frenchman, but the water was not so
clear. Then came the Indians; therefore Indians are
not of light complexion, because they did not find
the water when it was clear. Afterwards came the
Spaniard, and he was not white, because the water had
become very muddy.</p>

<p>Some time after the Negro was made. The One
Above thought he should attend to work, so he made
the Negro&rsquo;s nose flat. And by this time the water was
very muddy, and the stream was very low. So the
Negro washed only the palms of his hands. Therefore
Negroes are very black except on the palms of their
hands.</p>

<h2>STORY OF THE CREATION</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Gitche Manito, the Good Mystery,
created the earth-plain, it was bare, without
trees or shrubs. Then he created two
Indians, a man and a woman. Now when there were
ten persons on the earth-plain, death happened. The
first man lamented, and went back and forth over the
plain, complaining.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;Why did the Good Spirit send death so
soon?&rdquo; The Good Mystery heard this. He called a
great council. He said, &ldquo;Man is not happy. I have
made him very frail, therefore death happens. What
shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The council lasted six days, and there was not a
breath of air to disturb the waters. The seventh was
the <i>nageezhik</i>, the excellent day. The sky was blue
and there were no clouds. On that day Gitche Manito
sent down a messenger to earth. In his right hand was
a piece of white hare&rsquo;s skin, and in the left the head of
a white-headed eagle. On each was the blue stripe
of peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
The messenger said, &ldquo;Gitche Manito sent me. He
has heard your words. You must obey his commands.&rdquo;
Then he gave to the Indians the hare&rsquo;s skin, the eagle&rsquo;s
head, and a white otter skin with the blue stripe of
peace.</p>

<p>Thus Gitche Manito taught the Indians how to
make magic and how to be strong.</p>

<h2>CREATION<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">(A fragment)</span></h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ONG ago, Nokomis came down from Sky-land,
but remained fluttering in mid air. There was
no place on which to rest her foot.</p>

<p>The Fishes at once held a great council. Now
Tortoise had a shell-covered back, very broad. After
the council, he rose to the surface so that Nokomis
might rest upon his back. Then the drift-masses of
the sea gathered about the Tortoise. Thus the land
was made.</p>

<p>Then Nokomis found herself alone on the land. So
she married a manido from the Sky-land. Two sons
had Nokomis&mdash;twin brothers. But the brothers were
not friends. One was a good huntsman; the other
could kill no game at all. So they disputed. Then
one brother rose to the Sky-land. He caused the
Thunders to roar over his brother&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Now the sister of these twin brothers was the
ancestor of the Ojibwas.</p>

<h2>CREATION OF THE MANDANS</h2>

<p class="nation">Mandan</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Mandans were the People of the
Pheasants. They were the first people in the
world. At first they lived in the earth. Now,
in the dark Earth-land, they had many vines. Then at
last one vine grew up through a hole in the Earth-plain,
far above their heads. One of their young men at once
went up the vine until he came out on the Earth-plain.
He came out on the prairies, on the bank of a river,
just where the Mandan village now stands.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>He looked all about him. The Earth-plain was very
beautiful. There were many buffaloes there. He
killed one with his bow and arrow, and found it was
good for food.</p>

<p>Then the young man returned to his people under
the ground. He told them all he had seen. They held
a council, and then they began to climb up the vine to
the Earth-plain. Some of the chiefs, and the young
warriors, and many of the women went up. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
came a very fat woman. The chiefs said, &ldquo;Do not
go up.&rdquo; But she did, so the vine broke.</p>

<p>The Mandans were very sorry about this. Because
no more could go up, the tribe on the Earth-plain is not
very large. And no one could return to his village in
the ground. Therefore the Mandans built their village
on the banks of the river. But the rest of the
people remained underground.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE FLOOD</h2>

<p class="nation">Chitimacha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ONG, long ago, a great storm came. At once the
people baked a great earthen pot, and in this
two of them saved themselves. The pot was
held up on the surface of the water. Now two rattlesnakes
were also saved in the earthen jar, because in
the olden days rattlesnakes were the friends of man.
In those days, when an Indian left his lodge the rattlesnake
entered it and protected it until he returned.</p>

<p>When all the land was flooded, the red-headed woodpecker
hooked his claws into the sky and so hung above
the waters. But the flood rose so high that part of his
tail was wet. You can see the marks even to this day.</p>

<p>When the waters sank, he was sent to find land. He
could find none. Then a dove was sent and came back
with a grain of sand. This sand was placed on top of
the great waters and immediately it stretched out. It
became dry land. Therefore the dove is called
&ldquo;Ground Watcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE earth is a large tortoise. It moves very
slowly and carries a great deal of earth on its
back. Long ago there was a tribe which is
now dead. They used to dig deep down in the earth
for badgers. They dug with knives. One day they
stuck a knife far down into the earth. It cut through
the shell of Tortoise.</p>

<p>Therefore Tortoise at once began to sink into the
water. The water rose through the knife cut until it
covered all the ground. All the people were drowned
except one man.</p>

<p>But some of the old people say it was this way.
They say there were four Tortoises, one in the East,
one in the West, one in the South, and another in the
North. Each Tortoise made it rain for ten days.
Therefore the water covered the earth and all the
people were drowned.</p>

<h2>THE GREAT FLOOD</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ANABUSH<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> wanted to punish the evil
manidoes, the Ana maqkiu who had destroyed
his brother Wolf. Therefore he invented
the ball game.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_5_5">[5]</a></span>
The Manabozho of the Ojibwas.</p>
</div>

<p>The place selected by Manabush for a ball ground
was near a large sand bar on a great lake near Mackinac.
He asked the Thunderers to play against the Ana
maqkiu. These evil manidoes came out of the ground
as Bears. One chief was a silvery white bear, and the
other a gray bear. They played the ball game all day.
Manabush watched the game from a tree on a knoll.</p>

<p>When night came, Manabush went to a spot
between the places where the Bear chiefs had
played ball. He said, &ldquo;I want to be a pine tree, cut
off halfway between the ground and the top, with
two strong branches reaching out over the places
where the Bear chiefs lie down.&rdquo; At once he became
just such a tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
Now when the players came to the ball game the
next morning, the Bear chiefs at once said, &ldquo;This tree
was not standing there yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Thunderers at once said, &ldquo;Oh, yes. It was
there.&rdquo; Thus they argued. At last one Bear chief
said, &ldquo;This tree is Manabush. Therefore we will
kill him.&rdquo; At once they sent for Grizzly Bear. They
said, &ldquo;Climb this tree. Tear off the bark. Scratch
it.&rdquo; Grizzly Bear did so. He also bit the branches.</p>

<p>Then the Bear chiefs called to Serpent. They said,
&ldquo;Ho, Serpent! Come climb this tree. Bite it.
Strangle it in your coils.&rdquo; Serpent at once did so. It
was very hard for Manabush; yet he said nothing
at all.</p>

<p>Then the Bear chiefs said, &ldquo;No, it is not Manabush.
Therefore we will finish the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now when they were playing, someone carried the
ball so far that the Bear chiefs were left entirely alone.
At once Manabush drew an arrow from his quiver
and shot the White Bear chief. Then he shot another
arrow at Gray Bear chief. He wounded both of them.
Then Manabush became a man again and ran for the
sand bar. Soon the underground Ana maqkiu came
back. They saw the two Bear chiefs were wounded.
They immediately called for a flood from the earth to
drown Manabush. It came very quickly and followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
that one. Then Badger came. He hid Manabush in
the earth. As he burrowed, he threw the earth behind
him, and that held the water back. So the Ana maqkiu
could not find Manabush. Therefore they gave up
the search just as the water began to fill Badger&rsquo;s
burrow. So Manabush and Badger returned above
ground.</p>

<p>Now the underground people carried their chiefs
to a wigwam. They said to an old woman, &ldquo;Take
care of them.&rdquo; Then Manabush followed them. He
met the old woman. He took her skin and hid himself
in it. So he went into the wigwam. He killed both
the Bear chiefs. Then he took the skins of the bears.
When he came out of the wigwam he shook a network
of basswood twigs, so that the Ana maqkiu might know
he had been there.</p>

<p>At once they pursued him. Water poured out of the
earth in many places. A great flood came.</p>

<p>Manabush at once ran to the top of the highest
mountain. The waters followed him closely. He
climbed a great pine tree on the mountain top, but the
waters soon reached him. Manabush said to the pine,
&ldquo;Grow twice as high.&rdquo; At once it did so. Yet the
waters rose higher. Manabush said again to the tree,
&ldquo;Grow twice as high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said this four times, yet the waters kept rising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
until they reached his arm pits. Then Manabush
called to Kisha Manido for help. The Good Mystery
at once commanded the waters to stop.</p>

<p>Manabush looked around. There were only a few
animals in the water. He called, &ldquo;Ho, Otter! Come
to me and be my brother. Dive down into the water.
Bring up some earth that I may make a new world.&rdquo;
Otter dived down into the water and was gone a long
time. When he appeared again on the surface, Manabush
saw he was drowned.</p>

<p>Then he called again, &ldquo;Ho, Mink! Come to me
and be my brother. Dive down into the water. Bring
me some earth.&rdquo; Then Mink dived into the water.
He was gone a long time. He also was drowned.</p>

<p>Manabush looked about him again. He saw Muskrat.
He called, &ldquo;Ho, Muskrat! Come to me and be
my brother. Dive down into the water. Bring me up
earth from below.&rdquo; Muskrat immediately dived into
the water. He was gone a very long time. Then when
he came up, Manabush went to him. In his paw was a
tiny bit of mud. Then Manabush held Muskrat up,
and blew on him, so he became alive again.</p>

<p>Then Manabush took the earth. He rubbed it between
the palms of his hands and threw it out on
the water. Thus a new world was made and trees
appeared on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
Manabush told Muskrat that his tribe should
always be numerous, and that wherever his people
should live they should have enough to eat.</p>

<p>Then Manabush found Badger. To him he gave
the skin of the Gray Bear chief. But he kept for himself
the skin of the silvery White Bear chief.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span></p>

<h2>ORIGIN OF FIRE</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HILE Manabush was still a young man, he
said to Nokomis, the Earth, &ldquo;Grandmother,
it is cold here and we have no fire. I shall
go and get some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nokomis said, &ldquo;Oh, no! It is too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Manabush said, &ldquo;Yes, we must have fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At once Manabush made a canoe of birch bark.
Then he became a rabbit. So he started eastward,
across the great water, to a land where lived an old
man who had fire. He guarded the fire carefully so
that people might not steal it.</p>

<p>Now the old man had two daughters. One day they
came out of the sacred wigwam where the fire was
kept. Behold! There was a little rabbit, wet and cold
and trembling. They took it up at once in their arms.
They carried it into the wigwam. They set it down
near the fire.</p>

<p>So Manabush sat by the fire while the two girls were
busy. The old man was asleep. Then Rabbit hopped
nearer the fire. When he hopped, the whole earth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
shook. The old man roused. He said, &ldquo;My daughters,
what has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls answered, &ldquo;Nothing at all. We picked
up a little wet rabbit and are letting him dry by the
fire.&rdquo; Then again the old man fell asleep. The girls
were busy.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rabbit seized a stick of burning wood and
ran out of the wigwam. He ran with great speed
towards his canoe. The old man and the two girls
followed him closely. But Rabbit reached his canoe
and paddled quickly away, to the wigwam of Nokomis.
He paddled so quickly that the fire stick
burned fiercely. Sparks flew from it and burned
Rabbit.</p>

<p>At once Rabbit and Nokomis gave fire to the Thunderers.
They have had the care of fire ever since.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE THUNDERERS AND THE ORIGIN OF FIRE</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the Great Mystery created the earth,
he made also many manidos. Those of animal
form were People of the Underground,
and evil. But the bird manidos were Eagles and
Hawks. They were the Thunderers. The golden
eagle was the Thunder-which-no-one-could-see.</p>

<p>Now when Masha Manido, the Good Mystery, saw
that Bear was still an animal, he permitted him to
change his form. Thus Bear became an Indian, with
light skin. All this happened near Menomini River,
near where it empties into Green Bay. At this place
also Bear first came out of the ground.</p>

<p>Bear found himself alone, so he called to Eagle,
&ldquo;Ho, Eagle! come to me and be my brother.&rdquo; So
Eagle came down to earth and became an Indian.</p>

<p>While the Thunderers stood there, Beaver came
near. Now as Beaver was a woman, she became a
younger brother of the Thunderers. Soon after, as
Bear and Eagle stood on a river bank, they saw a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
stranger, Sturgeon. They called to him. Therefore
Sturgeon became Bear&rsquo;s younger brother and his servant.
So also Elk was adopted by the Thunderers.
He became a younger brother and water carrier.</p>

<p>At another time, Bear was going up Wisconsin River
and sat down to rest. Out from beneath a waterfall
came Wolf.</p>

<p>Wolf said, &ldquo;What are you doing in this place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bear said, &ldquo;I am traveling to the source of the river.
I am resting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then Crane came flying by. Bear called, &ldquo;Ho,
Crane. Carry me to my people at the head of the
river. Then will I make you my younger brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crane stopped and took Bear on his back. As he
was flying off, Wolf called, &ldquo;Ho, Bear. Take me also
as your younger brother. I am alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bear said, &ldquo;I will take Wolf as my younger
brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is how Wolf and Crane became younger brothers
of Bear. Wolf afterwards let Dog and Deer join
him, having seats in the council.</p>

<p>Now Big Thunder lived at Winnebago Lake, near
Fond du Lac. The Thunderers were all made by
Masha Manido to be of benefit to the whole world.
When they return from the Southwest in the spring,
they bring with them the rains which make the earth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
green and the plants and trees to grow. If it were not
for the Thunderers, the earth would be dry and all
things would perish.</p>

<p>Masha Manido gave to the Thunderers squaw corn,
which grows on small sticks and has ears of several
colors.</p>

<p>The Thunderers were also the Makers-of-Fire.
Manabush first gave it to them, but he had stolen it
from an old man living on an island in the middle of
a great lake.</p>

<p>Bear and Sturgeon owned rice, which grew abundantly
in the waters near Bear&rsquo;s village. One day the
Thunderers visited Bear&rsquo;s village and promised to give
corn and fire, if Bear would give them rice.</p>

<p>The Thunderers are the war chiefs and have charge
of the lighting of the fire. So Bear gave rice to them.
Then he built a long tepee and a fire was kindled in
the center by the Thunderers. From this all the people
of the earth received fire. It was carried to them
by the Thunderers. When the people travel, the
Thunderers go ahead to the camping place and start
the fire which is used by all.</p>

<h2>THE ORIGIN OF FIRE</h2>

<p class="nation">Chitimacha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>IRE first came from the Great Being, Kutnakin.
He gave it into the care of an Indian so old that
he was blind.</p>

<p>Now the Indians all knew that fire was good, therefore
they tried to steal it. The old man could not see
them when they came stealthily to his wigwam, but he
could feel the presence of anyone. Then he would
beat about him with his stick until he drove away the
seekers for fire.</p>

<p>Now one day an Indian seized the fire suddenly.
At once the Watcher of the Fire began beating about
him with his stick, until the thief dropped the fire.
But the old man did not know he had dropped it. He
still beat about him so fiercely with his stick that he
pounded some of the fire into a log.</p>

<p>That is why fire is in wood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE GIFTS OF THE SKY GOD</h2>

<p class="nation">Chitimacha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ONG, long ago, many Indians started to reach the
Sky-world. They walked far to the north
until they came to the edge of the sky, where
it is fitted down over the Earth-plain. When they
came to this place, they tried to slip through a crack
under the edge, but the Sky-cover came down very
tightly and quickly, and crushed all but six. These
six had slipped through into the Sky-land.</p>

<p>Then these men began to climb up, walking far over
the sky floor. At last they came to the lodge of Kutnakin.
They stayed with him as his guests. At last
they wished to go back to their own lodges on the
Earth-plain.</p>

<p>Kutnakin said, &ldquo;How will you go down to the
Earth-plain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One said, &ldquo;I will go down as a squirrel.&rdquo; So he
started to spring down from the Sky-land. He was
dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>Kutnakin said to the next, &ldquo;How will you go down
to the Earth-plain?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
And this man also went as an animal. And so the
next one also. They were dashed to pieces. Then the
others saw that they were crushed by their fall.</p>

<p>Therefore the fourth said, &ldquo;I will go down as a
spider.&rdquo; And he spun a long line down which he
climbed safely to earth.</p>

<p>The fifth said, &ldquo;I will go down as an eagle,&rdquo; and he
spread his wings and circled through the air until he
alighted on a tree branch.</p>

<p>The last one said, &ldquo;I will go down as a pigeon,&rdquo; and
so he came softly to earth.</p>

<p>Now each one brought back a gift from Kutnakin.
The one who came back as a spider had learned how to
howl and sing and dance when people were sick. He
was the first medicine man. But one Indian had died
while these six men were up in the Sky-land. He died
before the shaman came down to earth as a spider.
Therefore death came among the Indians. Had the
shaman come back to earth in time to heal this Indian,
there would have been no death.</p>

<h2>MONDAMIN</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the springtime came, long, long ago, an
Indian boy began his fast, according to the
customs of his tribe. His father was a very
good man but he was not a good hunter, and often
there was no food in the wigwam.</p>

<p>So, as the boy wandered from his small tepee in the
forest, he thought about these things. He looked at the
plants and shrubs and wondered about their uses, and
whether they were good for food. He thought, &ldquo;I
must find out about these things in my vision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day, as he lay stretched upon his bed of robes
in the solitary wigwam, a handsome Indian youth
came down from Sky-land. He was gaily dressed in
robes of green and yellow, with a plume of waving
feathers in his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sent to you,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;by the Great
Mystery. He will teach you what you would know.&rdquo;
Then he told the boy to rise and wrestle with him.
The boy at once did so. At last the visitor said, &ldquo;That
is enough. I will come tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
The next day the beautiful stranger came again from
the Sky-land. Again the two wrestled until the
stranger said, &ldquo;That is enough. I will come
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The third day he came again. Again the fasting
youth found his strength increase as he wrestled with
the visitor. Then that one said, &ldquo;It is enough. You
have conquered.&rdquo; He sat himself down in the wigwam.
&ldquo;The Great Mystery has granted your wish,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Tomorrow when I come, after we have
wrestled and you have thrown me down, you must strip
off my garments. Clear the earth of roots and weeds
and bury my body. Then leave this place; but come
often and keep the earth soft, and pull up the weeds.
Let no grass or weeds grow on my grave.&rdquo; Then he
went away, but first he said, &ldquo;Touch no food until
after we wrestle tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning the father brought food to his
son; it was the seventh day of fasting. But the boy
refused until the evening should come.</p>

<p>Again came the handsome youth from the Sky-land.
They wrestled long, until he fell to the earth. Then
the Indian boy took off the green and yellow robes,
and buried his friend in soft, fresh earth. Thus the
vision had come to him.</p>

<p>Then the boy returned to his father&rsquo;s lodge, for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
fasting was ended. Yet he remembered the commands
of the Sky-land stranger. Often he visited the grave,
keeping it soft and fresh, pulling up weeds and grass.
And when people were saying that the Summer-maker
would soon go away and the Winter-maker come, the
boy went with his father to the place where his wigwam
had stood in the forest while he fasted. There
they found a tall and graceful plant, with bright silky
hair, and green and yellow robes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Mondamin,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;It is Mondamin,
the corn.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<h2>MONDAMIN</h2>

<p class="nation">Ottawa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the Ottawas lived on the Manatoline
Islands, in Lake Huron, they had a very
strong medicine man. His name was Mass-wa-wei-nini,
Living Statue. Then the Iroquois came
and drove the Ottawas away. They fled to Lac Court
Oreilles, between Lake Superior and the Mississippi
River. But Living Statue remained in the land of his
people. He remained to watch the Iroquois, so that
his people might know of their plans. His two sons
stayed with him.</p>

<p>At night, the medicine man paddled softly around
the island, in his canoe. He paddled through the
water around the beautiful green island of his people.
One morning he rose early to go hunting. His two
boys were asleep. So Living Statue followed the game
trail through the forest; then he came to a wide green
plain. He watched keenly for the enemy of his people.
Then he began to cross the plain.</p>

<p>When Living Statue was in the middle of the plain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
he saw a small man coming towards him. He wore a
red plume in his hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Red Plume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am hunting,&rdquo; said Living Statue.</p>

<p>Red Plume drew out his pipe and they smoked
together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where does your strength come from?&rdquo; asked
Red Plume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the strength common to all men,&rdquo; said
Living Statue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must wrestle,&rdquo; said Red Plume. &ldquo;If you can
make me fall, you will cry, &lsquo;I have thrown you, <i>Wa
ge me na</i>!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now when they had finished smoking, they began to
wrestle. They struggled long. Red Plume was small,
but his medicine was strong. Living Statue grew
weaker and weaker, but at last, by a sudden effort, he
threw Red Plume. At once he cried, &ldquo;I have thrown
you, <i>Wa ge me na</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately Red Plume vanished. When Living
Statue looked at the place where he had fallen, he saw
only <i>Mondamin</i>, an ear of corn. It was crooked.
There was a red tassel at the top.</p>

<p>Someone said, &ldquo;Take off my robes. Pull me in
pieces. Throw me over the plain. Take the spine on
which I grew and throw it in shady places near the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
edge of the wood. Return after one moon. Tell no
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mass-wa-wei-nini did as the voice directed. Then
he returned into the woods. He killed a deer. So he
returned to his wigwam.</p>

<p>Now after one moon, he returned to the plain. Behold!
There were blades and spikes of young corn.
And from the broken bits of spine, grew long pumpkin
vines.</p>

<p>When summer was gone, Living Statue went again
to the plain with his sons. The corn was in full ear.
Also the large pumpkins were ripe.</p>

<p>Thus the Ottawas received the gift of corn.</p>

<h2>THE CORN WOMAN</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day a hunter could find no game. He had
but a few grains of corn with him. He was
very hungry. In the night a dream came to
him and he heard the sound of singing.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the hunter rose, but again
he found no game. When he slept again the dream
came to him, and again came the sound of singing,
but this time it was nearer. Yet again he could find
no game.</p>

<p>The third night the dream came to the hunter, and
when he awoke, he still heard the song. Then he rose
quickly and followed the song. At last he came to a
single green stalk of Selu.</p>

<p>The stalk spoke to him. It said, &ldquo;Take off my
roots, and take them with you to your wigwam. Tomorrow
morning you must chew them before anyone
awakes. Then go again into the woods. So will you
always be successful in hunting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The green stalk gave him many directions for hunting
the elk and the deer. So it talked until the sun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
rose to the very top of the sky trail. Immediately the
green stalk became a woman. She rose gracefully into
the air and vanished.</p>

<p>Then all the people knew that the hunter had seen
Selu, the Corn, wife of Kanati. Therefore the hunter
was always successful.</p>

<h2>DISCOVERY OF THE WILD RICE</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ONG ago, Weniboj&oacute;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> made his home with his
grandmother, Nokomis. One day Nokomis
said to her grandson, &ldquo;Prove yourself a man.
Take a long journey. Go through the great forests.
Fast you. Prepare for the hardships of life.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">

Manabush.</p>
</div>

<p>So Weniboj&oacute; took his bow and arrow from his wigwam.
He wandered out into the forest. Many days
he wandered. Then at last he reached a broad
lake, covered thick with heavy-headed stalks. But
Weniboj&oacute; knew not that the grain was food.</p>

<p>So Weniboj&oacute; went back to his grandmother, Nokomis.
He told her of the broad, quiet lake, with the
heavy-headed stalks. So Nokomis came, and in their
canoe they gathered the wild rice and sowed it in
another lake.</p>

</div>

<p>Again Weniboj&oacute; left Nokomis. With his bow and
arrow he wandered far into the forest. Then some
little bushes spoke as he walked. &ldquo;Sometimes they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
eat us,&rdquo; they said. Weniboj&oacute; made no answer. Again
the bushes spoke, &ldquo;Sometimes they eat us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you talking to?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Weniboj&oacute;,&rdquo; they said. So he bent down and
dug up the bushes by the roots. The roots were long,
like an arrow. They were good to eat, but Weniboj&oacute;
had fasted too long.</p>

<p>After a while, Weniboj&oacute; wandered on. He was
very hungry. Many bushes spoke to him. Many
said, &ldquo;Sometimes they eat us,&rdquo; but he made no answer.</p>

<p>One day he followed the river trail, when the sun
was high. Many little bunches of straw were growing
out of the water. They spoke to him. They said,
&ldquo;Weniboj&oacute;, sometimes they eat us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Weniboj&oacute; picked some of the grains from the
heavy-headed stalks and ate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are good to eat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What do they
call you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They call us <i>manomin</i>,&rdquo; answered the wild rice.</p>

<p>Then Weniboj&oacute; waded far out into the water. He
beat out grains and ate many. They were good for
food.</p>

<p>Then Weniboj&oacute; remembered the grain which Nokomis
had sown, and he returned to his grandmother and
the <i>manomin</i> lake.</p>

<h2>ORIGIN OF WILD RICE</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>OW one evening Weniboj&oacute; returned to his
wigwam from hunting. He had found no
game. As he came towards his fire, he saw a
duck sitting on the edge of a kettle of boiling water.
Immediately the duck flew away.</p>

<p>Weniboj&oacute; looked in the kettle. Behold! Grains
were floating upon the water. Then he ate the broth
made with the grains. It was good.</p>

<p>So Weniboj&oacute; followed the trail of the duck. He
came to a lake of <i>manomin</i>. All the birds and the
ducks and geese were eating the grain. Therefore
Weniboj&oacute; learned to know <i>manomin</i>, the wild rice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span></p>

<h2>ORIGIN OF WINNEBAGO</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day Manabush walked along the lake
shore. He was tired and hungry. Then he
saw, around a sand spit jutting far out into
the water, many waterfowl.</p>

<p>Now Manabush had with him only a medicine bag.
He hung that on a manabush tree in the brush. He
put a roll of bark on his back, and returned to the lake
shore. He passed slowly by so as not to frighten the
birds. Duck and Swan suddenly recognized him, and
swam quickly away from the shore.</p>

<p>One of the Swans called out, &ldquo;Ho! Manabush,
where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to have a dance,&rdquo; said Manabush.
&ldquo;As you may see, I have all my songs with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he called out to all the birds, &ldquo;Come to me,
brothers! Let us sing and dance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At once the birds returned to the shore and walked
back upon an open space in the grass. Manabush took
the bundle of bark from his back. He placed it on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
ground, got out his singing sticks, and then he said to
the birds,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, all of you dance around me as I drum. Sing
as loudly as you can and keep your eyes closed. The
first to look will always have red eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Manabush began to beat time upon his bundle
of bark. The birds with eyes closed danced around
him. Then Manabush began to keep time with one
hand, as the birds sang loudly. With the other he
seized a Swan by the neck. Swan gave a loud squawk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, brothers! Sing as loudly as you can,&rdquo;
shouted Manabush.</p>

<p>Soon he seized another Swan by the neck. Then he
seized a Goose. At last there were not so many birds
singing. Then a tiny duck opened his eyes to see why.
At once he shrieked, &ldquo;Manabush is killing us!
Manabush is killing us!&rdquo; And he started for the
water, followed by the rest of the birds.</p>

<p>Now this little duck was a poor runner. Manabush
quickly caught him and said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t kill you; but
you shall always have red eyes. And you shall be the
laughing stock of all the birds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that Manabush pushed him so hard, yet
holding on to his tail, that the duck went far out into
the middle of the lake and his tail came off. Because
of that he has red eyes and no tail, even to this day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
Then Manabush gathered up the birds he had killed
and took them out on the sand spit. He buried them in
the sand and built a fire over them to cook them, but
he left sticking out the heads of some and the legs of
others so he would know where they were.</p>

<p>But Manabush was tired. He slapped his thigh and
said, &ldquo;You watch the birds and awaken me if anyone
comes near them.&rdquo; He stretched out on the sand with
his back to the fire and went to sleep.</p>

<p>After awhile, Indians came along in their canoes.
They saw the fire and the roasting birds. They went
ashore on the sand pit. They pulled out the birds and
ate them. But they put back into the sand the heads
and feet, just as they had found them. So they
departed.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Manabush awoke, very hungry. He
pulled at the head of a swan. Behold! The head
came out, but there was no bird. He pulled at the feet
of a goose. No bird was there. So he tried every head
and foot; but the birds were gone.</p>

<p>He slapped his thigh again and asked, &ldquo;Who has
been here? Someone has robbed me of my feast. I
told you to watch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His thigh answered, &ldquo;I fell asleep also. I was very
tired. See! There are people moving away in their
canoes! They are dirty and poorly dressed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
Then Manabush ran to the point of the sand spit.
He could see the people who were just disappearing
around a point. He shouted, &ldquo;Winnebago! Winnebago!&rdquo;
Therefore the Menomini have always called
their thievish neighbors Winnebago.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE ORIGIN OF TOBACCO</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day when Manabush was passing by a high
mountain, a fragrant odor came to him from
a crevice in the cliffs. He went closer. Then
he knew that in the mountain was a giant who was the
Keeper of the Tobacco. He entered the mouth of a
cave, going through a long tunnel to the center of the
mountain.</p>

<p>There in a great wigwam was the giant. The giant
said sternly, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manabush said, &ldquo;I want some tobacco.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back again in one year,&rdquo; said the giant.
&ldquo;The manidoes have just been here for their smoke.
They come but once a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manabush looked around. He saw a great number
of bags filled with tobacco. He seized one and ran
out into the open air, and close after him came the
giant.</p>

<p>Up to the mountain tops fled Manabush leaping
from peak to peak. The giant came close behind him,
springing with great bounds. When Manabush
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
reached a very high peak, he suddenly lay flat on the
ground; but the giant, leaping, went over him and
fell into the chasm beyond.</p>

<p>The giant picked himself up, and began to climb up
the face of the cliff. He almost reached the top, hanging
to it by his hands. Manabush seized him, and
drew him upwards, and dropped him down on the
ground.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;For your meanness, you shall become
Kakuene, the jumper. You shall become the pest of
those who raise tobacco.&rdquo; Thus the giant became a
grasshopper.</p>

<p>Then Manabush took the tobacco, and divided it
amongst his brothers, giving to each some of the seed.
Therefore the Indians are never without tobacco.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span></p>

<h2>ORIGIN OF MAPLE SUGAR</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day Manabush returned from the hunt
without any food. He could find no game at
all. So Nokomis gathered all their robes, and
the beaded belts, and their belongings together. They
built a new wigwam among the sugar maple trees.</p>

<p>Nokomis said, &ldquo;Grandson, go into the woods and
gather for me pieces of birch bark. I am going to
make sugar.&rdquo; Manabush went into the woods. He
gathered strips of birch bark, which he took back to
the wigwam. Nokomis had cut tiny strips of the bark
to use as thread in sewing the bark into hollow buckets.
Then Nokomis went from tree to tree cutting small
holes through the maple bark, so that the sap might
flow. She placed a birch-bark vessel under each hole.
Manabush followed her from tree to tree looking
for the sap to drop. None fell. When Nokomis had
finished, Manabush found all the vessels half full.</p>

<p>He stuck his finger into the thick syrup. It was
sweet. Then he said, &ldquo;Grandmother, this is all very
good, but it will not do. If people make sugar so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
easily, they will not have to work at all. I will change
all this. They must cut wood and keep the sap boiling
several nights. Otherwise they will not be busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Manabush climbed to the very top of a tree. He
showered water all over the maples, like rain. Therefore
the sugar in the tree dissolved and flows from the
tree as thin sap. This is why the uncles of Manabush
and their children always have to work hard when they
want to make sugar.</p>

<h2>MANABUSH AND THE MOOSE</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ANABUSH killed a moose. He was very
hungry, but he was greatly troubled as to
how he should eat it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I begin at the head,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they will say I
ate him headfirst. But if I begin at the side, they will
say I ate him sideways. And if I begin at the tail, they
will say I ate him tail first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was greatly troubled. And while he thus spoke,
the wind blew two tree branches together. It made a
harsh, creaking sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot eat in this noise,&rdquo; said Manabush, and he
climbed the tree. Immediately the branches caught
him by the arm and held him. Then a pack of wolves
came and ate up the moose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span></p>

<h2>ORIGIN OF DAY AND NIGHT</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day as Wabus, the Rabbit, traveled through
a forest, he came to a clearing on the bank of
the river. There sat Totoba, the Saw-whet
Owl. The light was dim and Rabbit could not see
well. He said to Saw-whet,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you want it so dark? I do not like it. I
will cause it to be light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saw-whet said, &ldquo;Do so, if you are strong enough.
Let us try our powers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Rabbit and the Owl called a great council of the
birds. Some of the birds and animals wanted Rabbit
to succeed so that it would be light. Others wanted it
to remain dark.</p>

<p>Rabbit and Owl began to try their powers. Rabbit
began to repeat rapidly, &ldquo;<i>Wabon. Wabon. Wabon</i>&rdquo;
(Light. Light. Light), while Owl kept saying as
rapidly as he could, &ldquo;<i>Uni tipa qkot. Uni tipa qkot.
Uni tipa qkot</i>&rdquo; (Night. Night. Night).</p>

<p>If one of them should speak the word of the other,
he would lose. So Rabbit kept repeating rapidly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
&ldquo;<i>Wabon. Wabon. Wabon</i>,&rdquo; while Owl said as rapidly
as he could, &ldquo;<i>Uni tipa qkot. Uni tipa qkot. Uni
tipa qkot.</i>&rdquo; At last Owl said Rabbit&rsquo;s word, &ldquo;<i>Wabon</i>,&rdquo;
so he lost.</p>

<p>Therefore Rabbit decided there should be light.
But because some of the animals and birds could hunt
only in the dark, he said it should be night part of the
time. But all the rest of the time it is day.</p>

<h2>ORIGIN OF THE BEAR</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ONG ago, before the white man came, in the land
of the Cherokees was a clan called the Ani
Tsagulin. One of the boys of the clan used to
wander all day long in the mountains. He never ate
his food at home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you do so?&rdquo; asked his father and mother.
The boy did not answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you do so?&rdquo; they asked many days, as the
boy wandered away into the hills. He did not answer
them.</p>

<p>Then his mother saw that long brown hair covered
his body. They said again, &ldquo;Where do you go?&rdquo;
They asked, &ldquo;Why do you not eat at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last the boy said, &ldquo;There is plenty to eat there.
It is better than the corn in the village. Soon I shall
stay in the woods all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His father and mother said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy kept saying, &ldquo;It is better than here. I am
beginning to be different. Soon I shall not want to
live here. If you come with me you will not have to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
hunt, or to plant corn. But first you must fast seven
days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The people began to talk about it. They said,
&ldquo;Often we do not have enough to eat here. There he
says there is plenty. We will go with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they fasted seven days. Then they left their
village and went to the mountains.</p>

<p>Now the other tribes had heard what they had
talked in their village. At once they sent messengers.
But when the messengers met them, they had started
towards the mountains and their hair was long and
brown. Their nature was changing. This was because
they had fasted seven days. But the Ani Tsagulin
would not go back to their village. They said to the
others:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going where there is always plenty to eat.
Hereafter we shall be called <i>Yana</i>, bears. When you
are hungry, come into the woods and call us, and we
will give you food to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they taught these messengers how to call them
and to hunt them. Because, even though they may
seem to be killed, the Ani Tsagulin live forever.</p>

<h2>ORIGIN OF THE WORD CHICAGO</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE an Ottawa hunter and his wife lived on
the shores of Lake Michigan. Then the
hunter went south, toward the end of the lake,
to hunt. When he reached the lake<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> where he had
caught beaver the year before, it was still covered with
ice. Then he tapped the ice to find the thinner places
where the beaver families lived. He broke holes at
these weaker points in the ice, and went to his wigwam
to get his traps.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_8_8">[8]</a></span>
Between Milwaukee and Chicago, going south to where Chicago
now stands.</p>
</div>

<p>Now the hunter&rsquo;s wife chanced to pass one of these
holes and she saw a beaver on the ice. She caught it
by the tail and called to the hunter to come and kill it
quickly, before it could get back into the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the hunter, &ldquo;if I kill this beaver, the
others will become frightened. They will escape from
the lake by other openings in the ice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the woman became angry, and they quarreled.</p>

<p>When the sun was near setting, the hunter went out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
on the ice again, to set more traps. When he returned
to his tepee, his wife had gone. He thought she had
gone to make a visit. The next morning she had not
returned, and he saw her footprints. So he followed
her trail to the south. As he followed her trail, he saw
that the footprints gradually changed. At last they
became the trail of a skunk. The trail ended in a
marsh, and many skunks were in that marsh.</p>

<p>Then he returned to his people. And he called the
place, &ldquo;The Place of the Skunk.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">

Schoolcraft gives the origin of the word Chicago, as follows:</p>

<p>Chi-cag-o-wunz The wild leek or pole-cat plant.</p>

<p>Chi-ca-go Place of the wild leek.</p>

<p>It would really seem, from the myths and the origin of the word,
as given above, that the name originated from the great amount of
skunk weed on the marshes now covered by the city.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>OTAWATOMI Indians used to live in the
marshes where Chicago now stands. They sent
out word to the other tribes that hunting was
good. Then the Menomini Indians went to the

much. But when the Menomini Indians reached the
spot where the dogs barked, they found only skunks.</p>

<h2>THE COMING OF MANABUSH</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the daughter of Nokomis, the Earth,
died, Nokomis wrapped her new baby in
soft dry grass. She laid him on the ground
under a large wooden bowl. Then she mourned four
days for her daughter.</p>

<p>At the end of four days, Nokomis heard a sound in
her wigwam. It came from the wooden bowl. Then
she remembered. She took up the bowl. At once she
saw a tiny white rabbit, with trembling pink ears. She
took it up. She said, &ldquo;Oh, my dear little Rabbit. Oh,
my Manabush.&rdquo; She took care of him.</p>

<p>One day Rabbit hopped across the wigwam. The
earth shook. At once the evil underground spirits, the
Ana maqkiu, said to one another, &ldquo;What has happened?
A great manido is born somewhere!&rdquo; Immediately
they began to plot against him.</p>

<p>In this way Manabush came to earth. He soon grew
to be a young man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span></p>

The Manabozho of the Ojibwa given by Longfellow as Hiawatha.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE daughter of Nokomis, the Earth, is the
mother of Manabush, who is also the Fire.
Flint first grew up out of Nokomis, and was
alone. Then Flint made a bowl and filled it with
earth. Wabus, the Rabbit, came from the earth, and
became a man. Thus was Manabush created.</p>

<p>Beneath the earth lived the Underground People,
the enemies of Manabush. They were the Ana maqkiu
who annoyed him constantly, and sought to destroy
him.</p>

<p>Now Manabush shaped a piece of flint to make an
axe. While he was rubbing it on a rock, he heard the
rock make sounds:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ke ka <span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span> ke ka <span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span> ke ka <span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span> ke ka</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Goss <span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;goss <span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span> &nbsp; goss <span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;goss</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He soon understood what the rock was saying: that
he was alone on the earth. That he had neither father,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
mother, brother, nor sister. This is what Flint said
while Manabush was rubbing it upon the rock.</p>

<p>While he was thinking of this, he heard something
coming. It was Mokquai, the Wolf. He said to
Manabush, &ldquo;Now you have a brother, for I, too, am
alone. We shall live together and I will hunt for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manabush said, &ldquo;I am glad to see you, my brother.
Therefore I shall make you like myself.&rdquo; So he made
him a man.</p>

<p>Then Manabush and his brother moved away to the
shore of a lake and there built a wigwam. Manabush
told his brother of the evil spirits, the Underground
People, who lived beneath the water. He said,
&ldquo;Never go into the water, and never cross on the ice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now one day Wolf-brother went a-hunting. It was
late when he started back. He found himself on the
shore of the lake, just opposite the wigwam. He could
see it clearly. He did not want to make a long journey
around by the lake shore; therefore he began to cross
on the ice. When he reached the middle of the lake,
the ice broke. The Underground People pulled him
under the water and he was drowned.</p>

<p>Now Manabush knew this. He mourned four days
for Wolf-brother. On the fifth day, while he was following
the hunting trail, he saw him approaching.</p>

<p>Wolf-brother said, &ldquo;My fate will be the fate of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
our people. They will all die, but after four days they
will return.&rdquo; Then Manabush saw it was only the
shade of his brother.</p>

<p>Then he said, &ldquo;My brother, return to the place of
the setting sun. You are now called Naqpote. You
will have charge of the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wolf-shade said, &ldquo;If I go there, and others
follow me, we shall not be able to return when we
leave this place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manabush again spoke. He said, &ldquo;Go, Naqpote.
Prepare a wigwam for others. Build a large fire that
they may be guided to it. When they arrive there must
be a wigwam for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus Naqpote left the earth. He lives in the land
of the shades, in the country of the setting sun, where
the earth is cut off.</p>

<h2>MANABOZHO AND WEST</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ANABOZHO lived with his grandmother
Nokomis, the Earth, on the edge of a wide
prairie. The first sound he heard was that of
an owl. He quickly climbed down the tree. He ran
to Nokomis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noko,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I have heard a monido.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nokomis said, &ldquo;What kind of a noise did it make?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It said, <i>Ko ho, Ko ho!</i>&rdquo; said Manabozho.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is only a bird,&rdquo; said Nokomis.</p>

<p>One day Manabozho thought, &ldquo;It is very strange I
know so little and grandmother is so wise. I wonder
if I have any father or mother.&rdquo; He went back to the
wigwam. He was very silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said Nokomis.</p>

<p>Manabozho asked, &ldquo;Have I no father or mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now his mother had died when he was a very little
baby, but Nokomis did not want to tell him. At last
she said, &ldquo;West is your father. He has three brothers.
They are North, East, and South. They have great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
power. They travel on mighty wings. Your mother
is not alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manabozho said, &ldquo;I will visit my father,&rdquo; but he
meant to make war on him because he had learned that
his father had not been kind to his mother and he
meant to punish him.</p>

<p>Manabozho started on his journey. He traveled
very rapidly. He went very far at each step. So at
last he met his father, West, on the top of a high
mountain. West was glad to see his son. Manabozho
pretended to be glad.</p>

<p>They talked much. One day the son asked, &ldquo;What
are you most afraid of on earth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said West.</p>

<p>Manabozho said, &ldquo;Oh, yes, there must be something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last West said, &ldquo;There is a black stone on earth.
I am afraid of that. If it should strike me, it would
injure me.&rdquo; West said this was a great secret.</p>

<p>One day he asked Manabozho, &ldquo;What are you most
afraid of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there must be something you are afraid
of,&rdquo; said West.</p>

<p>The son said, &ldquo;<i>Ie-ee Ie-ee</i>&mdash;it is&mdash;it is&mdash;&rdquo; He
seemed afraid to mention it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
West said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid!&rdquo; Then at last his son
said, &ldquo;It is the root of the <i>apukwa</i>, the bulrush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They quarreled because West had not been kind to
the mother of Manabozho.</p>

<p>Some days later they quarreled. Manabozho said,
&ldquo;I will get some of the black rock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Do not do so,&rdquo; cried West.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said his son.</p>

<p>West said at once, &ldquo;I will get some of the <i>apukwa</i>
root.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; cried Manabozho, pretending to be
afraid. &ldquo;Do not! Do not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said West.</p>

<p>Manabozho at once went out and brought to his
father&rsquo;s wigwam a large piece of black rock. West
pulled up and brought in some bulrush roots. Manabozho
threw the black rock at West. It broke in
pieces. Therefore you may see pieces lying around
even to this day. West struck his son with the bulrush
root. Thus they fought. But at last Manabozho drove
West far over the plains to the Darkening Land. So
West came to the edge of the world, where the earth is
broken off short. Then he cried, &ldquo;Stop, my son! I
am immortal, therefore I cannot be killed. I will
remain here on the edge of the Earth-plain. You must
go about doing good. You must kill monsters and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>

The Ojibwas have a similar myth.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER his brother Wolf had died, Manabush
looked about him. He found he was no longer
alone on earth. There were many other people,
the children of Nokomis. They were his aunts and
uncles.</p>

<p>The evil manidoes annoyed the people very much.
Therefore Manabush wished to destroy them. Therefore
he went to the shores of the lake where they lived.
He called to the waters to disappear. Four times he
called out. At once the waters vanished. There lay
the Ana maqkiu. They lay on the mud in the bottom
of the lake. They looked like fishes. The chief lay
near the shore. He was very large.</p>

<p>Manabush said to Great Fish, &ldquo;I shall destroy you
because you will not allow my people to come near the
shore.&rdquo; So he went towards Great Fish. But the
smaller manidoes caused the waters to return. Thus
they all escaped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
Then Manabush went into the woods. He made a
canoe of birch bark. He wanted to destroy Great Fish
in the water. As he left the shore in his canoe, he
began to sing, &ldquo;Great Fish, come and swallow me.&rdquo;
Only the young fish came near. Manabush said scornfully,
&ldquo;I do not wish you. I want your chief to come
and swallow me.&rdquo; Great Fish was much annoyed. He
darted forward and swallowed Manabush and his
canoe.</p>

<p>Thus Manabush found himself in the Great Fish.
He looked about him. Many of his people were there.
Bear and Deer, Porcupine and Raven, Buffalo, Pine-tree
Squirrel, and many others.</p>

<p>Manabush said to Buffalo, &ldquo;My uncle, how did you
get here? I never saw you near the water, but always
on the prairie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Buffalo said, &ldquo;I came near the lake to get some fresh
green grass. Great Fish caught me.&rdquo; And thus said
all the animals. They said, &ldquo;We came near the lake
and Great Fish swallowed us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Manabush said, &ldquo;We will now have to go to
the shore of Nokomis, my grandmother. You will all
have to help me.&rdquo; At once they all began to dance
around inside of Great Fish. Therefore he began to
swim quickly towards shore. Manabush began to cut
a hole over his head, so they could get out when Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
Fish reached the shore of Nokomis, the Earth. They
sang a magic song. They sang, &ldquo;I see the sky. I see
the sky.&rdquo; Pine Squirrel had a curious voice. He
hopped around singing, &ldquo;<i>Sek-sek-sek-sek!</i>&rdquo; This was
very amusing to the other people.</p>

<p>Great Fish thought, &ldquo;I ought not to have swallowed
that man. I must swim to the shore where Nokomis
lives.&rdquo; So he swam quickly until he reached the beach.
Then Manabush cut a larger hole. Thus they all
climbed out of Great Fish. The birds helped Manabush.
They stood on the sides of Great Fish and
picked the flesh from his bones.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

Mackinac. When he reached there, he made
a high, narrow rock, and this he leaned against
the cliff. This rock is as high as an arrow can be shot
from a bow. At this place he was seen by his people
for the last time. Before he went, he talked with them.</p>

<p>Manabush said, &ldquo;I am going away now. I have

visit a rock near Mackinac where the old men
said Manabush was living. They built a long

<h2>THE REQUEST FOR IMMORTALITY</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day long after Manabush had gone away
from his people, an Indian dreamed that he
spoke to him. At daylight, he sought seven
friends, chief men of the Mita-wit. They held a
council together, and then rose and went in search of
Manabush.</p>

<p>The Dreamer blackened his face.</p>

<p>On the shore of the Great Waters, they entered
canoes, and paddled toward a rocky place in the Land
of the Rising Sun. Very long they paddled over the
water, until they reached the land where dwelt
Manabush.</p>

<p>Soon they reached his wigwam. Manabush bade
them enter. The door of the wigwam lifted and fell
again as each one entered. When all were seated,
Manabush said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friends, why is it you have come so long a
journey to see me? What is it you wish?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All but one answered, at once: &ldquo;Manabush, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
wish some hunting medicine; thus we may supply our
people with much food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have it,&rdquo; said Manabush. Then he
turned to the silent one. He asked, &ldquo;What do you
wish?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Indian replied, &ldquo;I wish no hunting medicine.
I wish to live forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manabush rose and went towards the Indian. He
took him by the shoulders and carried him to his
sleeping place. He set him down, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall be a stone. Thus you shall be everlasting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately the other Indians arose and went down
to the shore. In their canoes they returned to their
own land. It is from these seven who returned that
we know of the abode of Manabush.</p>

<h2>PEBOAN AND SEEGWAN</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ONG ago an old man sat alone in his lodge beside
a frozen stream. The fire was dying out, and
it was near the end of winter. Outside the
lodge, the cold wind swept before it the drifting snow.
So the old man sat alone, day after day, until at last a
young warrior entered his lodge. He was fresh and
joyous and youthful.</p>

<p>The old man welcomed him. He drew out his long
pipe and filled it with tobacco. He lighted it from the
dying embers of the fire. Then they smoked together.</p>

<p>The old man said, &ldquo;I blow my breath and the
streams stand still. The water becomes stiff and hard
like the stones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I breathe,&rdquo; said the warrior, &ldquo;and flowers spring
up over the plain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shake my locks,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;and snow
covers the land. Leaves fall from the trees. The birds
fly away. The animals hide. The earth becomes hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shake my locks,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
warm rain falls. Plants blossom; the birds return; the
streams flow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the sun came up over the edge of the Earth-plain,
and began to climb the trail through the Sky-land.

<h2>THE GRAVE FIRES</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> SMALL war party of Ojibwas fought, long
ago, with enemies on an open plain. Then their
chief was shot by an arrow in his breast as he
rode after the retreating enemy. When his warriors
found their chief dead, they placed him, sitting, with
his back against a tree. They left him there with his
bow and arrows.</p>

<p>But the chief was not dead. He saw the warriors
leave him and he ran after them as they rode the homeward
trail. He followed closely in their trail. He
slept in their camp, yet they did not see him.</p>

<p>When the war party reached their own village, they
sang the song of victory, yet they sent up the death wail
for those who were killed. The women and children
came out. The chief heard his warriors tell of his
death. He said, &ldquo;No, I am not dead,&rdquo; but they did
not hear him.</p>

<p>Then the chief went to his own wigwam. His wife
was weeping, and wailing for his death. &ldquo;I am here,&rdquo;
he said, but she did not hear him. &ldquo;I am hungry,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
he said. She made no answer. Only she raised again
the death wail.</p>

<p>Then the chief thought. Perhaps only his spirit had
returned. Perhaps his body was yet on the field of
battle. So he followed the trail back to the battle field.
It was a four days&rsquo; journey. For three days he saw
no one as he journeyed. The fourth day, on the edge
of the plain, he saw a fire in his trail. He walked to
one side and the other; the fire moved also and always
burned before him. Then he turned in another direction.
The fire was again in his trail. Then he sprang
suddenly, and jumped through the flame.</p>

<p>At once he awoke. He was sitting on the ground,
with his back against a tree. Over his head in the
branches sat a large war eagle. Now Eagle was his
guardian, because he had come to him in his fasting
vision in his youth.</p>

<p>Then the wounded chief arose. He followed the
trail of the war party to his village. Four days he
followed the homeward trail. He came to a stream
which flowed between him and his wigwam, therefore
he gave the whoop which means the return of an
absent friend. Then the Indians began to think. They
said, &ldquo;No one is absent. Perhaps it is an enemy.&rdquo; So
they sent over a canoe with armed men. Thus the
chief landed among his own people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
Then the chief gave them instructions. He said it
was pleasing to a spirit to have a fire burning at the
grave for four days after the body was buried. This
was because it is four days&rsquo; journey on the death trail
to the Ghost-land; so the spirit needed a fire at his
camping place every evening.</p>

<p>Also he said the spirit needed his bow and arrow,
his best robes, in his journey. Therefore the Ojibwas
burn a fire four nights at a new grave, that the spirit
may be happy in following the Trail of the Dead to
the Spirit-land.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<h2>THE DEATH TRAIL</h2>

<p class="nation">Choctaw</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER a man dies, he must travel far on the death
trail. It journeys to the Darkening-land, where
Sun slips over the edge of the Earth-plain. Then
the spirit comes to a deep, rapid stream. There are
steep and rugged hills on each side, so that one may not
follow a land trail. The Trail of the Dead leads over
the stream, and the only bridge is a pine log. It is a
very slippery log, and even the bark has been peeled
off. Also on the other side of the bridge are six persons.
They have rocks in their hands, and throw them
at spirits when they are just at the middle of the log.</p>

<p>Now when an evil spirit sees the stones coming, he
tries to dodge them. Therefore he slips off the log.
He falls far into the water below, where are evil things.
The water carries him around and around, as in a
whirlpool, and then brings him back again among the
evil things. Sometimes evil spirit climbs up on the
rocks and looks over into the country of the good
spirits. But he cannot go there.</p>

<p>Now the good spirit walks over safely. He does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
mind the stones and does not dodge them. He crosses
the stream and goes to a good hunting land. It is more
beautiful there than on the Earth-plain. There are no
storms. The sky is always blue, and the grass is green,
and there are many buffaloes. Therefore there is
always feasting and dancing.</p>

<p>Shingebiss had no fear of the cold. He would go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
out on the coldest day. He would seek for places
where rushes and flags grew through the ice. He
pulled them up and dived through the broken ice for
fish. Thus he had plenty of food. Thus he went to his
wigwam dragging long strings of fish behind him on
the ice.</p>

<p>North West noticed this. He said, &ldquo;Shingebiss is
a strange man. I will see if I cannot get the better
of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>North West shook his rattle and the wind blew
colder. Snow drifted high. But Shingebiss did not
let his fire go out. In the worst storms he continued
going out, seeking for the weak places in the ice where
the roots grew.</p>

<p>North West noticed this. He said, &ldquo;Shingebiss is
a strange man. I shall go and visit him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night North West went to the door of the
wigwam. Shingebiss had cooked his fish and eaten it.
He was lying on his side before the fire, singing songs.</p>

<p>He sang,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
Now he sang this because he knew North West was
standing at the door of his wigwam. He could feel his
cold breath. He kept right on singing his songs.</p>

<p>North West said, &ldquo;Shingebiss is a strange man. I
shall go inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therefore North West entered the wigwam and sat
down on the opposite side of the lodge. Shingebiss
lay before the fire and sang:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spirit of North West, you are but my fellow man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he got up and poked the fire. The wigwam
became very warm. At last North West said, &ldquo;I cannot
stand this. I must go out. Shingebiss is a very
strange man.&rdquo; So he went out.</p>

<p>Then North West shook his rattles until the great
storms came. Thus there was much ice and snow and
wind. All the flag roots were frozen in hard ice. Still
Shingebiss went fishing. He bit off the frozen flags
and rushes, and broke the hard ice around their roots.
He dived for fish and went home dragging strings of
fish behind him on the ice.</p>

<p>North West noticed this. He said, &ldquo;Shingebiss
must have very strong medicine. Some manito is
helping him. I cannot conquer him. Shingebiss is a
very strange man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he let him alone.</p>

<h2>HOW THE HUNTER DESTROYED SNOW</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE a hunter with his wife and two children
lived in a tepee. Each day the hunter went out
for game. He was a good hunter and he
brought back much game.</p>

<p>But one day, after autumn had gone and winter had
come, the hunter met Kon, Snow, who froze his feet
badly. Then the hunter made a large wooden bowl
and filled it with Kon. He buried it in a deep hole
where the midday sun could shine down upon it, and
where Snow could not run away. Then he covered
the hole with sticks and leaves so that Snow would be
a prisoner until summer.</p>

<p>Now when midsummer came, and everything was
warm, the hunter came back to this hole and pulled
away the sticks and leaves. He let the midday sun
shine down upon Kon so that he melted. Thus the
hunter punished Kon.</p>

<p>But when autumn came again, one day the hunter
heard someone say to him, when he was in the forest:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
&ldquo;You punished me last summer, but when winter
comes I will show you how strong I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hunter knew it was Kon&rsquo;s voice. He at once
built another tepee, near the one in which he lived,
and filled it full of firewood.</p>

<p>At last winter came again. When the hunter was in
the forest one day, he heard Kon say: &ldquo;Now I am
coming to visit you, as I said I should. In four days
I shall be at your tepee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the hunter returned home, he made ready
more firewood; he built a fire at the two sides of the
tepee. After four days, everything became frozen. It
was very cold. The hunter kept up the fires in the
tepee. He took out all the extra fur robes to cover
his wife and children. The cold became more severe.
It was hard not to freeze.</p>

<p>On the fifth day, towards night, the hunter looked
out from his tepee upon a frozen world. Then he saw
a stranger coming. He looked like any other stranger,
except that he had a very large head and an immense
beard. When he came to the tepee, the hunter asked
him in. He at once came in, but he would not go near
either of the fires. This puzzled the hunter, and he
began to watch the stranger.</p>

<p>It became colder and colder after the stranger had
come into the tepee. The hunter added more wood to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
each of the fires until they roared. The stranger
seemed too warm. The hunter added more wood, and
the stranger became warmer and warmer. Then the
hunter saw that as he became warm, he seemed to
shrink. At last his head and body were quite small.
Then the hunter knew who the stranger guest was. It
was Kon, the Cold. So he kept up his fires until Kon
melted altogether away.</p>

<h2>THE PIPE OF PEACE</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N THE olden days, so they say, the Indians fought
much. Always they followed the war trail. Then
Gitche Manito, the Good Mystery, thought,
&ldquo;This is not well. My children should not always
follow the war trail.&rdquo; Therefore he called a great
council. He called all the tribes together. Now this
was on the upper Mississippi.</p>

<p>Gitche Manito stood on a great wall of red rock. On
the green plain below him were the wigwams of his
children. All the tribes were there.</p>

<p>Gitche Manito broke off a piece of the red rock. He
made a pipe out of it. He made a pipe by turning it in
his hands. Then he smoked the pipe, and the smoke
made a great cloud in the sky.</p>

<p>He spoke in a loud voice. He said, &ldquo;See, my people,
this stone is red. It is red because it is the flesh of all
tribes. Therefore can it be used only for a pipe of
peace when you cease to follow the war trail. Therefore
it is the Place of Peace. To all the tribes it
belongs.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
Then the cloud grew larger and Gitche Manito
vanished in it.</p>

<p>Now therefore, because of the command of Gitche
Manito, the Indians smoke the pipe of peace when they
cease to follow the war trail. And because it is the
Place of Peace, the tomahawk and the scalping knife
are never lifted there.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

buffaloes ran over the rocks and made them red.</p>

<p>Gitche Manito was then a very large bird. We can
still see his tracks in the red stone. Now it happened
a large snake crawled out of its hole to eat the eggs of
the Bird. Then at once the egg hatched out in a clap

<p>Gitche Manito took a piece of stone to throw at the
snake. He shaped it in his hands like to a man.</p>

<p>Now this man&rsquo;s feet stood fast in the ground where
he was. Thus he stayed for many ages; therefore he
grew very old. He was older than a hundred men at

It grew a long while, until a snake bit off the roots.

<h2>PAU-PUK-KEE-WIS</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> MAN found himself standing alone on the
prairie. He was very large and strong. He
thought to himself, &ldquo;How did I come here?
Am I all alone on the earth? I must travel until I find
the abode of men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he started out. After a long time he came to a
wood. There were decayed stumps there, very old, as
if cut in the olden times. Again he journeyed a long
time. He came to a wood in which there were more
stumps, newly cut. Then he came to the fresh trail of
people. He saw wood just cut, lying in heaps. At
sunset he came out of the forest. He saw a village of
many lodges standing on rising ground.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;I will go there on the run.&rdquo; He ran.
When he came to the first lodge, he sprang over it.
Those within saw something pass over the smoke hole.
They heard a thump on the ground.</p>

<p>They said, &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; They ran out. They
invited him to enter. Many warriors were in the
wigwam, and an old chief.</p>

<p>The chief said, &ldquo;Where are you going? What is
your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
He said, &ldquo;I am in search of adventures. I am Pau-puk-kee-wis.&rdquo;
Then they laughed.</p>

<p>After a short time he went on. A young man went
with him as his <i>mesh-in-au-wa</i>, as his pipe bearer.</p>

<p>As they journeyed, Pau-puk-kee-wis did strange
things. He leaped over trees. He whirled on one foot
until dust clouds were flying.</p>

<p>One day a large village of wigwams came in their
trail. They went to it. The chief told them of evil
manitoes who had killed all the people going to that
village. War parties had been sent against them. The
warriors were all killed.</p>

<p>Pau-puk-kee-wis said, &ldquo;I will go and visit them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chief said, &ldquo;Oh, no. They are evil. They will
kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pau-puk-kee-wis said, &ldquo;I will go and visit them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the chief said, &ldquo;I will send twenty warriors
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Pau-puk-kee-wis, with his pipe bearer and
twenty warriors, started off at once. They came near
that lodge. Pau-puk-kee-wis said, &ldquo;Hide here. Thus
you will be safe. You will see what I do.&rdquo; He went
to that lodge. He entered.</p>

<p>The manitoes were very ugly. They were evil
looking. There were a father and four sons. They
offered him food. He refused it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
The old manito said, &ldquo;What have you come for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Pau-puk-kee-wis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to wrestle?&rdquo; asked the manito.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pau-puk-kee-wis.</p>

<p>At once the eldest brother rose and they began to
wrestle. These manitoes were very evil. They wished
to kill Pau-puk-kee-wis in order to eat him. But that
man was very strong. He tripped the manito. Then
he threw him down. His head struck on a stone.</p>

<p>The next brother wrestled with Pau-puk-kee-wis.
He fell. Then the other two wrestled. All four fell
on the ground. The old manito began to run. Pau-puk-kee-wis
pursued him. He pursued him in a very
queer way, just for fun. Sometimes he leaped over
him and ran ahead. Sometimes he pushed him ahead
from behind.</p>

<p>All the twenty warriors cried, &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! Ha!
ha! ha! Pau-puk-kee-wis is driving him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last Pau-puk-kee-wis killed him. Thus all the
evil manitoes were dead.</p>

<p>Then they looked on the bones of the warriors and
people who had been killed by those evil ones. Then
Pau-puk-kee-wis took three arrows. He performed a
ceremony to Gitche Manito. He shot one arrow. He
cried, &ldquo;You who are lying down, rise up or you will
be hit.&rdquo; At once the bones all moved to one place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
He shot a second arrow. He cried, &ldquo;You who are
lying down, rise up, or you will be hit.&rdquo; The proper
bones moved together, toward each other.</p>

<p>He shot a third arrow. He cried, &ldquo;You who are
lying down, rise up, or you will be hit.&rdquo; The people
became alive again. Then Pau-puk-kee-wis led them
back to the village of the friendly chief.</p>

<p>This one then came to him with his council. He
said, &ldquo;You should rule my people. You only are able
to defend them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pau-puk-kee-wis said, &ldquo;I am going on a journey.
Let my pipe bearer be chief.&rdquo; So he was.</p>

<p>Pau-puk-kee-wis began his journey. &ldquo;Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo;
cried all the people. &ldquo;Come back again. Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He journeyed on. He came to a lake made by
beavers.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> He stood on the beaver dam and watched.
He saw the head of a beaver peering out.</p>

With a smile he spake in this wise:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&ldquo;O, my friend, Ahmeek, the beaver,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cool and pleasant is the water;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let me dive into the water,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let me rest there in your lodges;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Change me, too, into a beaver!&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Cautiously replied the beaver,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With reserve he thus made answer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&ldquo;Let me first consult the others,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let me ask the other beavers.&rdquo;<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
&ldquo;Make me a beaver like yourself,&rdquo; said Pau-puk-kee-wis.
He wanted to see how beavers lived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go and ask what the others have to say,&rdquo;
said Beaver.</p>

<p>Soon all the beavers looked out to see if he were
armed. He had left his bow and arrow in a hollow
tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make me a beaver,&rdquo; said Pau-puk-kee-wis. &ldquo;I
wish to live among you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Beaver chief. &ldquo;Lie down.&rdquo; He lay
down. He found himself a beaver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must make me large,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Beaver chief. &ldquo;When we get into the
lodge, you shall be made very large.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they all dived down into the water again. They
passed heaps of tree limbs and logs lying on the bottom
of the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are these for?&rdquo; asked Pau-puk-kee-wis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For our winter food,&rdquo; said Beaver chief.</p>

<p>Now when they got into the lodge, they made Pau-puk-kee-wis
very large. They made him ten times
larger than themselves.</p>

<p>Soon a beaver came running in. He cried, &ldquo;The
Indians are hunting us.&rdquo; At once all the beavers ran
out of the lodge door on the bottom of the river. Pau-puk-kee-wis
was too large. He could not get out. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
Indians broke down the dam. They lowered the water.
They broke in the lodge. They saw that one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Ty-au! Ty-au!</i>&rdquo; cried the Indians. &ldquo;<i>Me-sham-mek</i>,
the chief of the beavers, is here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they killed him. Yet Pau-puk-kee-wis kept
thinking. They placed his great body on a pole.
Seven or eight Indians carried it. They went back to
their lodges. They sent out invitations for a great
feast. Then the women came out to skin him on the
snow. When his flesh became cold, the <i>Jee-bi</i> of Pau-puk-kee-wis
went away. His spirit went away.</p>

<p>So Pau-puk-kee-wis found himself standing alone
on a prairie. Soon there came near by a herd of elk.
He thought, &ldquo;They are very happy. I will be an elk.&rdquo;
He went near them, and said, &ldquo;Make me an elk. I
wish to live among you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They said, &ldquo;Yes. Get down on your hands and
knees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon he found himself an elk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want big horns and big feet,&rdquo; said Pau-puk-kee-wis.
&ldquo;I want to be very large.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the elk. So they made him very
large. At last they said, &ldquo;Are you large enough?&rdquo;
Pau-puk-kee-wis said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he lived with the elks. One cold day they all
went into the woods for shelter. Soon some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
herd came racing by like a strong wind. At once all
began to run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep out on the prairies,&rdquo; they said to Pau-puk-kee-wis.</p>

<p>But he was so large he got tangled up in the thick
woods. He soon smelt the hunters. They were all
following his trail. Pau-puk-kee-wis jumped high.
He broke down saplings. Then the hunters shot him.
He jumped higher. He jumped over the tree tops.
Then all the hunters shot him. So they killed him.
Then they skinned him. When his flesh became cold,
the spirit of Pau-puk-kee-wis went away.</p>

<p>Thus Pau-puk-kee-wis had many adventures. After
a long time Manabozho killed him. Then he was
really dead because he was killed in his human form.
Manabozho said, &ldquo;You shall not be permitted to live
on the earth again. I will make you a war eagle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus Pau-puk-kee-wis became a war eagle. He
lives in the sky.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>AGOO was a great boaster. Once he told the
people of a water lily he had seen. He said the
leaf was large enough to make garments for his
wife and daughter.</p>

<p>One evening Iagoo was sitting in his wigwam, on
the bank of the river. He heard ducks quack on the
stream. He shot at them, without aiming. He shot
through the door of the wigwam. Behold! His
arrow pierced a swan flying by. It killed many ducks
in the stream. The arrow flew farther. It killed two

loons, just coming up from beneath the water. Then
it killed a very large fish.</p>

<p>Iagoo went hunting. He followed the trail of the
deer through the forest. He shot a deer and skinned it.
He lifted the meat upon his shoulders. As he came
from his hunting place, Iagoo saw a person on a
prairie before him. He pursued that person. Iagoo
ran half a day after that one. Then he remembered the
meat upon his shoulders. He remembered he carried
the body of the deer.</p>

<p>Iagoo had many adventures. He found mosquitoes
in a bog-land. They were very large. The wing of
one he used for a sail for his canoe, when the breeze
blew. The nose of that insect was as large as his wife&rsquo;s
digging stick.</p>

<p>One day Iagoo watched a beaver&rsquo;s lodge. He
watched for the peering head of a beaver. Behold!
An ant went by. She had killed a hare. She dragged
hare&rsquo;s body on the ground behind her.</p>

<h2>OJEEG, THE SUMMER-MAKER</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>JEEG was a great hunter. He lived on the
southern shore of Lake Superior. Ojeeg had
a wife and one son.</p>

<p>Now the son hunted game as the father taught him.
He followed the trails over the snow. For snow lay
always on the ground. It was always cold. Therefore
the boy returned home crying.</p>

<p>One day as he went to his father&rsquo;s wigwam in the
cold and snow he saw Red Squirrel, gnawing the end
of a pine cone. Now the son of Ojeeg had shot nothing
all day because his hands were so cold. When he saw
Red Squirrel, he came nearer, and raised his bow.</p>

<p>Red Squirrel said, &ldquo;My grandson, put up your
arrow. Listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy put the arrow in his quiver.</p>

<p>Red Squirrel said, &ldquo;You pass my wigwam very
often. You cry because you cannot kill birds. Your
fingers are numb with cold. Obey me. Thus it shall
always be summer. Thus you can kill many birds.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
Red Squirrel said again, &ldquo;Obey me. When you
reach your father&rsquo;s wigwam, throw down your bow
and arrows. Begin to weep. If your mother says,
&lsquo;My son, what is the matter?&rsquo; do not answer her.
Continue weeping. If she says, &lsquo;My son, eat this,&rsquo; you
must refuse the food. Continue weeping. In the
evening when your father comes in he will say to your
mother, &lsquo;What is the matter with my son?&rsquo; She will
say, &lsquo;He came in crying. He will not tell me.&rsquo; Your
father will say, &lsquo;My son, what is the matter? I am a
spirit. Nothing is too hard for me.&rsquo; Then you must
answer, &lsquo;It is always cold and dreary. Snow lies
always upon the ground. Melt the snow, my father,
so that we may have always summer.&rsquo; Then your
father will say, &lsquo;It is very difficult to do what you ask.
I will try.&rsquo; Then you must be quiet. You must eat the
food they give you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus it happened.</p>

<p>Ojeeg then said, &ldquo;I must make a feast. I must invite
my friends to go on this journey with me.&rdquo; At once
Ojeeg killed a bear. The next day he had a great
feast. There were Otter, Beaver, and Lynx. Also
Wolverine and Badger were at the feast.</p>

<p>Then they started on their journey. On the
twentieth day they came to the foot of a high mountain.
There was blood in the trail. Some person had killed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
an animal. They followed the trail of that person.
They arrived at a wigwam.</p>

<p>Ojeeg said, &ldquo;Do not laugh. Be very quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man stood in the doorway of the wigwam. He
was a great manito. He was a head only. Thus he
was very strange. Then he made a feast for them. He
made very curious movements, so Otter laughed. At
once the manito leaped upon him. He sprang on him,
but Otter slipped out from under him and escaped.</p>

<p>The manito and the animals talked all night. The
manito said to Ojeeg, the Fisher, &ldquo;You will succeed.
You will be the summer-maker. But you will die.
Yet the summer will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now when they followed the trail in the morning,
they met Otter. He was very cold and hungry, therefore
Fisher gave him meat.</p>

<p>Then they journeyed on. On the twentieth day, they
came to the top of a lofty mountain. Then they
smoked their pipes.</p>

<p>Then Ojeeg, the Fisher, and the animals prepared
themselves. Ojeeg said to Otter, &ldquo;We must first make
a hole in the Sky-cover. You try first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otter made a great spring. He did not even touch
the Sky-cover. He fell back, down the hill, to the
bottom of the hill. Then Otter said, &ldquo;I will go home.&rdquo;
So he did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
Then Beaver tried. He fell. Also Lynx and
Badger fell.</p>

<p>Then Wolverine tried. He made a great leap and
touched the sky. Then he leaped again. He pressed
against the Sky-cover. He leaped a third time. The
Sky-cover broke, and Wolverine went into the Sky-land.
Fisher also sprang in quickly after him.</p>

<p>Thus Wolverine and Fisher were in the Sky-plain,
in the summer land. There were many flowers and
streams of bright water. There were birds in the
trees, and fish and water birds on the streams. Many
lodges stood there, but they were empty. In each lodge
were many <i>mocuks</i>, many bird cages, with birds in
them.</p>

<p>At once Ojeeg began to cut the <i>mocuks</i>. The birds
flew out. They flew down through the hole in the Sky-cover
to the Earth-plain below. They carried warm
air down with them.</p>

<p>Now when the people of the Sky-land saw these
strangers, and their birds escaping, they ran to their
wigwams. But they were too late. Spring, and summer,
and autumn had slipped down the hole in the
Sky-cover. Endless summer was just passing through,
but they broke it in two with a blow. Therefore only
a part of endless summer came down to the Earth-plain.</p>

<p>Now when Wolverine heard the noise of the sky
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
people, running to their lodges, he jumped down the
hole and escaped. Fisher also tried to jump, but the
people had shut the cover. Therefore Fisher ran and
the people pursued him. He climbed a great tree in
the north, and the people began shooting at him. Now
Fisher was a spirit; he could not be hurt except in the
tip of his tail. At last they shot him in his tail.</p>

<p>Fisher called to the Sky People to stop shooting.
But they did not stop until darkness came. Then they
went away. Fisher climbed down. He went towards
the north. He said, &ldquo;I have kept my promise to my
son. The seasons will now be different. There will
be many moons without snow and cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus Fisher died, with the arrow sticking in his tail.
It can be seen there, even to this day.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<h2>RABBIT GOES DUCK HUNTING</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">R</span>ABBIT was very boastful. One day he met
Otter. Otter said, &ldquo;Sometimes I eat ducks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I eat ducks, too,&rdquo; said Rabbit.</p>

<p>So they went up the stream until they saw several
ducks in the water. They followed the trail softly.
Then they stood on the river bank.</p>

<p>Rabbit said, &ldquo;You go first.&rdquo; At once Otter dived
from the bank. He swam under water until he
reached a duck; then he pulled it under quickly so
that the other ducks were not frightened. While he
was under water, Rabbit peeled bark from a sapling
and made a noose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, watch me,&rdquo; he said, when Otter came back.
He dived in and swam under water until he was nearly
choked. So he came to the top to breathe. He did this
several times. The last time he came up among the
ducks and threw the noose over the head of one.</p>

<p>Duck spread her wings and flew up, with Rabbit
hanging to the end of the noose. Up and up flew the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
duck, but Rabbit could not hold on any longer. Then
he let go and dropped.</p>

<p>Rabbit fell into a hollow sycamore. It was very
tall, and had no hole at the bottom. Rabbit stayed
there until he was so hungry he ate his own fur, even
as he does to this day.</p>

<p>After many days, he heard children playing around
the tree. He began to sing,</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cut a door and look at me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&rsquo;m the prettiest thing you ever did see.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The children at once ran home to tell their father.
He came and cut a hole in the tree. As he chopped
away, Rabbit kept singing,</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cut it larger, so you can see me. I am very pretty.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So they made the hole larger. Then Rabbit told
them to stand back so they could get a good look at
him. They stood back. Then Rabbit sprang out and
leaped away.</p>

<h2>RABBIT AND THE TAR BABY</h2>

<p class="nation">Biloxi</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">R</span>ABBIT aided his friend the Frenchman with
his work. They planted potatoes. Rabbit
looked upon the potato vines as his share of the
crop and ate them all.</p>

<p>Again Rabbit aided his friend the Frenchman.
This time they planted corn. When it was grown,
Rabbit said, &ldquo;This time I will eat the roots.&rdquo; So he
pulled up all the corn by the roots, but he found
nothing to satisfy his hunger.</p>

<p>Then the Frenchman said, &ldquo;Let us dig a well.&rdquo;
Rabbit said, &ldquo;No. You dig it alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Frenchman said, &ldquo;Then you shall not drink
water from the well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That does not matter,&rdquo; said Rabbit. &ldquo;I am used to
licking off the dew from the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Frenchman dug his well. Then he made a
tar baby and stuck it up close to the well. One day
Rabbit came near the well, carrying a long piece of
hollow cane and a tin bucket. When he reached the
well he spoke to the tar baby; it did not answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
&ldquo;Friend, what is the matter? Are you angry?&rdquo;
asked Rabbit.</p>

<p>Tar baby did not answer. So Rabbit hit him with
a forepaw. The forepaw stuck there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; said Rabbit, &ldquo;or I will hit you on
the other side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tar baby paid no attention, so Rabbit hit him with
the other forepaw, and that stuck fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will kick you,&rdquo; said Rabbit. But when he kicked
him the hindpaw stuck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will kick you with the
other foot.&rdquo; So he kicked him with the other foot and
that stuck fast. By that time Rabbit looked like a
ball, all four paws sticking to the tar baby.</p>

<p>Just then the Frenchman came to the well. He
picked Rabbit up, tied his paws together, laid him
down and scolded him. Rabbit pretended to be in
great fear of a brier patch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are so afraid of a brier patch,&rdquo; said the
Frenchman, &ldquo;I will throw you into one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; said Rabbit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will throw you into the brier patch,&rdquo; repeated
the Frenchman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am much afraid of it,&rdquo; answered Rabbit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you are in such dread of it, I will throw you
into it,&rdquo; said the Frenchman. So he picked up Rabbit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
and threw him far into the brier patch. Rabbit fell
far away from the Frenchman.</p>

<p>Then he picked himself up and ran off, laughing at
the trick he had played on the Frenchman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span></p>

<h2>RABBIT AND TAR WOLF</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE the weather was dry for so long that
there was no more water in the springs and
creeks. The animals held a council to see
what to do about it. They decided to dig a well, and
all agreed to help, except Rabbit who was a lazy
fellow.</p>

<p>Rabbit said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to dig for water. The
dew on the grass is enough for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others did not like this, but they all started to
dig the well. It stayed dry for a long while and even
the water in the well was low. Still Rabbit was
lively and bright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rabbit steals our water at night,&rdquo; they said. So
they made a wolf of pine gum and tar. They set it
by the well to scare the thief.</p>

<p>That night Rabbit came again to the well. He saw
the black thing there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he asked. But Tar Wolf did not
answer. Rabbit came nearer. Yet Tar Wolf did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
move. Rabbit grew brave and said, &ldquo;Get out of my
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tar Wolf did not move. So Rabbit hit him with
his paw; but it stuck fast in the gum.</p>

<p>Rabbit became angry and said, &ldquo;Let go my paw!&rdquo;
Still Tar Wolf said nothing. So Rabbit hit him with
his hind foot; that stuck in the gum.</p>

<p>So Tar Wolf held Rabbit fast until morning. Then
the other animals came for water. When they found
Rabbit stuck fast, they made great fun of him for a
while. At last Rabbit managed to get away.</p>

<h2>RABBIT AND PANTHER</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">R</span>ABBIT was a great boaster. He wanted a
medicine lodge and to have people think he
was a great medicine man.</p>

<p>Now one day, Wabus, the Rabbit, and his wife were
traveling. They came to a low hill covered with poplar
sprouts. They were green and tender. Therefore
Rabbit decided to make his home there.</p>

<p>Rabbit went first to the top of a hill and built a wigwam.
He made trails from it in all directions, so he
might see anyone who approached.</p>

<p>When the wigwam was finished, Rabbit told his
wife he was going to dance; but first he ran all about
the hill to see if anyone was watching him. He found
no trail. Then he returned and began his song.</p>

<p>Now just as Rabbit returned to his wigwam,
Panther reached the base of the hill, and he found
Rabbit&rsquo;s trail. He followed it until he reached the
place where Rabbit and his wife were dancing. Here
he hid to watch Rabbit.</p>

<p>Now Rabbit told his wife to sit at one end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
lodge while he went to the other. He took his medicine

<p>Then he shot at his wife, just as a medicine man does
when he shoots at a new member. Then Rabbit&rsquo;s wife
arose and shot at him. Thus they were very happy.</p>

<p>Then Rabbit began to sing a song which meant
this: &ldquo;If Panther comes across my trail while I am
biting the bark from the poplars, he will not be able
to catch me for I am a good runner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had finished his song, Rabbit told his wife
he would go out hunting. Panther waited for his
return.</p>

<p>Now as Rabbit started home again he was very
happy. But when he reached Panther&rsquo;s hiding place,
his enemy sprang on his trail. Rabbit saw him and
started back on his trail. Panther raced after him.
He caught him and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the man who said I could not catch you.
Now who is the fastest runner?&rdquo; And before Rabbit
could answer Panther ate him up. But Rabbit was
such a boastful man.</p>

<h2>HOW RABBIT STOLE OTTER&rsquo;S COAT</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>LL the animals were of different sizes and wore
different coats. Some wore long fur and
others wore short fur. Some had rings on
their tails; others had no tails at all. The coats of the
animals were of many colors&mdash;brown, or black, or
yellow, or gray.</p>

<p>The animals were always quarreling about whose
coat was the finest. Therefore they held a council to
decide the matter.</p>

<p>Now everyone had heard a great deal about Otter,
but he lived far up the trail; he did not often visit the
others. It was said he had the finest coat of all, but
it was so long since they had seen him that no one
remembered what it was like. They did not even know
just where he lived, but they knew he would come
when he heard of the council.</p>

<p>Rabbit was afraid the council would say that Otter
had the finest coat. He learned by what trail Otter
would come to the council. Then he went a four days&rsquo;
march up the trail to meet him. At last he saw Otter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
coming. He knew him at once by his beautiful coat of
soft brown fur.</p>

<p>Otter said, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They sent me to bring you to the council,&rdquo;
answered Rabbit. &ldquo;They were afraid you might not
know the trail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Rabbit turned back and they traveled together.
They traveled all day. At night Rabbit picked out a
camping place. Otter was a stranger in that part.
Rabbit cut down bushes for beds and made everything
comfortable. Next morning they started on again.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Rabbit picked up pieces of bark
and wood, as they followed the trail, and loaded them
on his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you doing that?&rdquo; asked Otter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that we may be warm and comfortable tonight,&rdquo;
said Rabbit. Near sunset they stopped and made
camp. After supper Rabbit began to whittle a stick,
shaving it down to a paddle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you doing that?&rdquo; asked Otter again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Rabbit, &ldquo;I have good dreams when I
sleep with a paddle under my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the paddle was finished, Rabbit began to cut
a good trail through the bushes to the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you doing that?&rdquo; asked Otter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is called &lsquo;The Place Where It Rains Fire,&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
and sometimes it does rain fire here,&rdquo; said Rabbit.
&ldquo;The sky looks a little that way tonight. You go to
sleep and I will sit up and watch. If you hear me
shout, you run and jump into the river. Better hang
your coat on that limb over there, so it will not get
burned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otter did as Rabbit told him; then both curled up
and Otter went to sleep. But Rabbit stayed awake.
After a while the fire burned down to red coals. Rabbit
called to Otter; he was fast asleep. Then he called
again, but Otter did not awaken.</p>

<p>Then Rabbit rose softly. He filled the paddle with
hot coals, threw them up into the air and shouted, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
raining fire! It&rsquo;s raining fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hot coals fell on Otter and he jumped up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the river,&rdquo; shouted Rabbit and Otter fled into
the water. So he has lived in the water ever since.</p>

<p>Rabbit at once took Otter&rsquo;s coat and put it on, leaving
his own behind. Then he followed the trail to the
council.</p>

<p>All the animals were waiting for Otter. At last they
saw him coming down the trail. They said to each
other, &ldquo;Otter is coming!&rdquo; They sent one of the small
animals to show him the best seat. After he was seated,
the animals all went up in turn to welcome him. But
Otter kept his head down with one paw over his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
The animals were surprised. They did not know
Otter was so bashful. At last Bear pulled the paw
away. There was Rabbit! He sprang up and started
to run. Bear struck at him and pulled the tail off his
coat. But Rabbit was too quick and got safely away.</p>

<h2>RABBIT AND BEAR</h2>

<p class="nation">Biloxi</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">R</span>ABBIT and Bear had been friends for some
time. One day Rabbit said to Bear, &ldquo;Come
and visit me. I live in a very large brier
patch.&rdquo; Then he went home.</p>

<p>When he reached home he went out and gathered a
quantity of young canes which he hung up.</p>

<p>After a while Bear reached a place near his house,
but was seeking the large brier patch. Now Rabbit
really dwelt in a very small patch. When Rabbit
found that Bear was near, he began to make a pattering
sound with his feet.</p>

<p>Bear was scared. He retreated to a distance and
then stopped and stood listening. As soon as Rabbit
saw this, he cried out, &ldquo;Halloo! my friend! Was it
you whom I treated in that manner? Come and take a
seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Bear went back to Rabbit&rsquo;s house and took a seat.
Rabbit gave the young canes to his guest, who swallowed
them all. Rabbit nibbled now and then at one,
while Bear swallowed all the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
&ldquo;This is what I have always liked,&rdquo; said Bear when
he went home. &ldquo;Come and visit me. I dwell in a
large bent tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not long after, Rabbit started on his journey. He
spent some time seeking the large bent tree but he
could not find it. Bear lived in a hollow tree, and he
sat there growling. Rabbit heard the growls and fled
for some distance before he sat down.</p>

<p>Then Bear called, &ldquo;Halloo! my friend! Was it
you whom I treated in that manner? Come here and
sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rabbit did so.</p>

<p>Bear said, &ldquo;You are now my guest, but there is
nothing for you to eat.&rdquo; So Bear went in search of
food.</p>

<p>Bear went to gather young canes, but as he went
along, he gathered also the small black bugs which
live in decayed logs. When he had been gone some
time, he returned to his lodge with only a few young
canes. He put them down before Rabbit and then
walked around him in a circle. In a little while, he
offered Rabbit the black bugs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never eaten such food,&rdquo; said Rabbit.</p>

<p>Bear was offended. He said, &ldquo;When I was your
guest, I ate all the food you gave me, as I liked it very
well. Now when I offer you food, why do you treat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
me in this way?&rdquo; Then Bear said, also, &ldquo;Before the
sun sets, I shall kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rabbit&rsquo;s heart beat hard from terror, for Bear stood
at the entrance of the hollow log to prevent his escape.
But Rabbit was very nimble. He dodged first this
way and then that, and with a long leap he got out of
the hollow tree. He went at once to his brier patch
and sat down.</p>

<p>Rabbit was very angry with Bear. He shouted to
him, &ldquo;When people are hunting you, I will go toward
your hiding place, and show them where you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is why, when dogs hunt a rabbit, they always
shoot a bear. That is all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span></p>

<h2>WHY DEER NEVER EAT MEN</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER Rabbit had decided about light and darkness,
he saw Owasse, the Bear, coming.</p>

<p>Rabbit said, &ldquo;Bear, what do you want for
food?&rdquo; Bear said, &ldquo;Acorns and fruit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Rabbit asked Fish Hawk. He said, &ldquo;Fish
Hawk, what will you select for your food?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fish Hawk said, &ldquo;I will take that fellow, Sucker,
lying in the water there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sucker said at once, &ldquo;You may eat me if you can, but
that has still to be decided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sucker at once swam out into the deepest part of
the river, where Fish Hawk could not reach him.
Then Fish Hawk rose into the air to a point where
his shadow fell exactly on the spot where Sucker lay.
Now as Sucker lay there, he saw the shadow of a large
bird on the bed of the stream. He became frightened.
He thought, &ldquo;It must be a manido,&rdquo; so he swam
slowly to the surface. At once Fish Hawk darted
down on him and carried him into the air. Then he
ate him.</p>

<p>Rabbit looked about him again. He saw Moqwaio,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
the Wolf. He cried, &ldquo;Ho, Wolf! What do you wish
for food?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wolf said, &ldquo;I will eat Deer.&rdquo; Deer said, &ldquo;You
cannot eat me, because I can run too swiftly.&rdquo; Wolf
said, &ldquo;We will see about that.&rdquo; So they had a race.
Deer started ahead and ran very swiftly. Wolf ran
swiftly, too, but his fur robe was too heavy. At last
he thought, &ldquo;This robe is too heavy. I will slip it
off.&rdquo; So he threw it off. Then he bounded ahead and
caught Deer and ate him.</p>

<p>Then Rabbit asked another Deer, of the same totem,
&ldquo;Deer, what will you select as food?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deer said, &ldquo;I will eat people. There are many Indians
in the country. I will eat them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At once all the animals began to talk. They said to
Deer, &ldquo;The Indian is too powerful. You can never
eat him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deer said, &ldquo;Well, I will plan to eat Indians, anyway.&rdquo;
Then he walked off.</p>

<p>Now one day an Indian was out hunting. He saw
deer tracks to the right and so followed them. They
went in a large circle until they brought him back
where he had started. Then he saw deer tracks to the
left. So he followed those, until they also brought him
back, in a large circle, to the point where he started.
Then the Indian saw that Deer was following him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
Deer was determined to eat the Indians, because
there were many of them. It would not be difficult to
hunt for food. But first he wanted to frighten the
hunter. So he pulled two ribs from his sides, and
stuck them into his lower jaw. They looked like
tusks. Deer looked very fierce. Then Deer came
walking along, looking for an Indian. But the hunter
raised his bow and shot Deer. He carried the deer
meat back to his wigwam.</p>

<p>The shade of Deer at once went to the council of
birds and animals. He told Rabbit all about it.</p>

<p>Rabbit said, &ldquo;I told you that you could not eat people.
You see how it is? Now you will have to live
on grass and twigs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so they do, even to this day.</p>

<h2>HOW RABBIT SNARED THE SUN</h2>

<p class="nation">Biloxi</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">R</span>ABBIT and his grandmother lived in a wigwam.
Rabbit used to go hunting every day,
very early in the morning. But no matter how
early he went, a person leaving long footprints had
passed along ahead of him. Each morning Rabbit
thought, &ldquo;I will reach there before him.&rdquo; Yet each
morning the person leaving long footprints passed
before him.</p>

<p>One morning Rabbit said to his grandmother, &ldquo;Oh,
Grandmother, although I have long wished to be the
first to get there, again has he got there ahead of me.
Oh, Grandmother, I will make a noose, and I will
place it in the trail of that one, and thus I will catch
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should you do that?&rdquo; asked grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate that person,&rdquo; said Rabbit. He departed.
When he reached there, he found that the person had
already departed. So he lay down near by and waited
for night. Then he went to the trail where the person
with long feet had been passing, and set a snare.</p>

Very early the next morning he went to look at his
trap. Behold! Sun had been caught. Rabbit ran
home very quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grandmother, I have caught something but it
scares me. I wished to take the noose, but it scared me
every time I went to get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Rabbit took a knife and again went there.
The person said, &ldquo;You have done very wrong. Come
and release me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rabbit did not go directly toward him. He went to
one side. He bent his head low and cut the cord. At
once Sun went above on his trail. But Rabbit had
been so near him that Sun burned his fur on the back
of his neck.</p>

<p>Rabbit ran home. He cried, &ldquo;Oh, Grandmother, I
have been severely burned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! My grandson has been severely burned,&rdquo;
said grandmother.</p>

<h2>WHEN THE ORPHAN TRAPPED
THE SUN</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>NIMALS and men lived on the earth in the beginning.
The animals killed all the people
except a girl and her tiny brother, who hid
from them. The brother did not grow at all. Therefore
when the sister collected firewood, she took him
with her. She made him a bow and arrow.</p>

<p>One day she said, &ldquo;Now I must leave you for a
while. Soon the snowbirds will come and pick worms
out of the wood I have cut. Shoot one of them and
bring it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy waited. The birds came and he shot at
them with his arrows. He could not kill one. The
next day he shot at them again. Then he killed one.
He came back to the wigwam with a bird.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;My sister, skin it. I will wear the skins
of the snowbirds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do with the body?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut it in two. We will put it in our broth.&rdquo; Now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
at that time, the animals were very large. People did
not eat them.</p>

<p>The boy killed ten snowbirds. Then his sister made
a coat for him. One day he said, &ldquo;Are we alone on
the Earth-plain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;The animals who live in such a place
have killed all our relatives. You must never go
there.&rdquo; Therefore he went in that direction.</p>

<p>Now he walked a long while and met no one. Then
he lay down on a knoll where the sun had melted the
snow. He fell asleep. Then Sun looked down at him
and burned his bird-skin coat. He tightened it so that
the boy was bound into it. When he awoke, the boy
said to Sun, &ldquo;You are not too high. I will pay you
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went home. He said to his sister, &ldquo;Sun has
spoiled my coat.&rdquo; He would not eat. He lay down on
the ground. He lay ten days on one side. Then he
turned over and lay ten days on the other side.</p>

<p>At last he rose. He said to his sister, &ldquo;Make me a
snare. I shall catch Sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;I have no string.&rdquo; The boy said, &ldquo;Make
a string.&rdquo; Then she remembered a bit of dried sinew
which her father had had. So she made a snare for
him.</p>

<p>The boy said, &ldquo;That will not do. Make a better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
snare.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I have no string.&rdquo; At last she remembered.
She cut off some of her hair. She made
a string from that.</p>

<p>The boy said, &ldquo;That will not do. Make me a noose.&rdquo;
She thought again. Then she remembered. She went
out of the wigwam. She took something. She made a
braid out of that thing.</p>

<p>The boy said, &ldquo;This will do.&rdquo; He was much
pleased. When he took it, it became a long red cord.
There was much of it. He wound it around his body.</p>

<p>The boy left the wigwam while Sun was at home.
He did this so that he might catch him as he came over
the edge of the earth. He put the noose at the spot
just where Sun came over the edge. When Sun came
along, the noose caught his head. He was held tight,
so that he could not follow his trail in the Sky-land.</p>

<p>Now the animals who ruled the earth were frightened
because Sun did not follow the trail. They said,
&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; So they called a great council.
They said, &ldquo;We must send someone to cut the noose.&rdquo;
Thus they spoke in the council.</p>

<p>Now all the animals were afraid to cut the cord.
Sun was so hot he would burn them. At last Dormouse
said, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo; He stood up in the council.
He was as high as a mountain. He was the largest of
all the animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
When Dormouse reached the place where Sun was
snared, his fur began to singe and his back to burn. It
was very hot. Dormouse cut the cord with his teeth.
But so much of him was burned up, he became very
small. Therefore Dormouse is the smallest of animals.
That is why he is called Kug-e-been-gwa-kwa.</p>

<h2>THE HARE AND THE LYNX</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE there was a little white hare, living in
a wigwam with her grandmother. Now
Grandmother sent Hare back to her native
land. When Hare had gone a short way, Lynx came
down the trail. Lynx sang:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Tshwee! Tshwee! Tshwee! Tshwee!</i>&rdquo; cried Hare,
and ran back to Grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, Grandmother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Lynx came down
the trail and sang,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said Grandmother. &ldquo;Have courage! Tell
Lynx you are going to your native land.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
Hare went back up the trail. Lynx stood there, so
Hare sang,</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To the point of land I go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is the home of the little white one,<br /></span>

<p>Lynx looked at the trembling little hare, and began
to sing again,</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Little white one, tell me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little white one, tell me,<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Tshwee! Tshwee! Tshwee! Tshwee!</i>&rdquo; cried little
Hare, and ran back to Grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, Grandmother,&rdquo; said Hare, &ldquo;Lynx came down
the trail and sang,</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Little white one, tell me,<br /></span>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said Grandmother, &ldquo;Go and tell him your
uncles made them so when they came from the South.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Hare ran up the trail and sang,</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My uncles came from the south;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They made my ears as they are.<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
And then Hare laid her little pink ears back upon
her shoulders, and started to go to the point of land.
But Lynx sang again,</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">Why do you go away, little white one?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do you go away, little white one?<br /></span>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Tshwee! Tshwee! Tshwee! Tshwee!</i>&rdquo; cried Hare
and again she ran back to Grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! do not mind him,&rdquo; said Grandmother. &ldquo;Do
not listen to him. Do not answer him. Just run
straight on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the little white hare ran up the trail as fast as
she could. When she came to the place where Lynx
had stood, he was gone. So Hare ran on and had
almost reached her native land, on the point of land,
when Lynx sprang out of the thicket and ate her up.</p>

<h2>WELCOME TO A BABY</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ITTLE WREN is the messenger of the Birds.
She pries into everything. She gets up early
in the morning and goes around to every wigwam
to get news for the Bird council. When a new
baby comes into a wigwam, she finds out whether it is
a boy or a girl.</p>

<p>If it is a boy, the Bird council sings mournfully,
&ldquo;Alas! The whistle of the arrow! My shins will
burn!&rdquo; Because the Birds all know that when the
boy grows older he will hunt them with his bows and
arrows, and will roast them on a stick.</p>

<p>But if the baby is a girl, they are glad. They sing,
&ldquo;Thanks! The sound of the pestle! In her wigwam
I shall surely be able to scratch where she sweeps.&rdquo;
Because they know that when she grows older and
beats the corn into meal, they will be able to pick up
stray grains.</p>

<p>Cricket also is glad when the baby is a girl. He
sings, &ldquo;Thanks! I shall sing in the wigwam where
she lives.&rdquo; But if it is a boy, Cricket laments, &ldquo;<i>Gwo-he!</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
He will shoot me! He will shoot me! He will
shoot me!&rdquo; Because boys make little bows to shoot
crickets and grasshoppers.</p>

<p>When the Cherokee Indians hear of a new baby,
they ask, &ldquo;Is it a bow, or a meal sifter?&rdquo; Or else they
ask, &ldquo;Is it ball-sticks or bread?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SONG OF THE MOTHER BEARS</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day a hunter in the woods heard singing in

<p>Another hunter out in the woods one day thought

<h2>THE MAN IN THE STUMP</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>N INDIAN had a field of corn ripening in the
sun. One day when he wanted to look at it,
he climbed a stump. Now the stump was hollow
and in it was a nest of bear cubs. The man slipped
and fell down upon the cubs.</p>

<p>At once the cubs began calling for their mother, and
Mother Bear came running. She began to climb down
into the stump backwards. Then the Indian caught
hold of her leg; thus she became frightened. She began
to climb out and dragged the Indian also to the
top of the stump. Thus he got out of the stump.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Ancient of Ants was building a house.
She worked hard to finish her house before
the cold weather came.</p>

<p>Now when it was very cold, the Katydid and the
Locust reached her house, asking for shelter. They
said they had no houses.</p>

<p>The Ancient of Ants scolded them. She said,
&ldquo;After you are grown up, in the warm weather, you
sing all the time, instead of building a house.&rdquo; She
would not let them come into her house.</p>

<p>Then the Katydid and the Locust were ashamed,
and as the weather was very cold, they died. That is
why katydids and locusts die every winter, while the
ants live in their warm houses. But the katydids and
locusts never do anything in warm weather but sing.</p>

<h2>WHEN THE OWL MARRIED</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE there was a widow with only one daughter.
She said often, &ldquo;You should marry and
then there will be a man to go hunting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then one day a man came courting the daughter.
He said, &ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl said, &ldquo;I can only marry a good worker.
We need a man who is a good hunter and who will
work in the cornfield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am exactly that sort of a man,&rdquo; he said. So the
mother said they might marry.</p>

<p>Then the next morning the mother gave the man a
hoe. She said, &ldquo;Go, hoe the corn. When breakfast
is ready I will call you.&rdquo; Then she went to call him.
She followed a sound as of someone hoeing on stony
soil. When she reached the place, there was only a
small circle of hoed ground. Over in the thicket someone
said, &ldquo;Hoo-hoo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the man came back in the evening, the mother
said, &ldquo;Where have you been all day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;Hard at work.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
The mother said, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was over in the thicket cutting sticks to mark off
the field,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did not come to the lodge to eat at all,&rdquo;
she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was too busy,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Early the next morning he started off with his hoe
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Then the mother went again to call him, when the
meal was ready. The hoe was lying there, but there
was no sign of work done. And away over in the
thicket, she heard a hu-hu calling, <i>Sau-h! sau-h!
sau-h! hoo-hoo! hoo-hoo! hoo-hoo! chi! chi! chi!
whew!</i></p>

<p>Now when the man came home that night, the
mother asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing all day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Working hard,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you were not there when I came after you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I went over in the thicket awhile,&rdquo; said the
man, &ldquo;to see some of my relatives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the mother said, &ldquo;I have lived here a long
while, and no one lives in that swamp but lazy hu-hus.
My daughter wants a husband that can work and not a
hu-hu!&rdquo; And she drove him from the house.</p>

he who is said to fly so high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eagle answered, &ldquo;Oh, you crooked tongue! You
are below my notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the birds flew very swiftly; but they tired
and flew back to earth. Now Eagle went far above all.
When Eagle could fly no farther, Linnet, who had
perched upon Eagle&rsquo;s back, flew up. Far above Eagle
flew the tiny gray bird.</p>

<p>Now when the Birds held a council again, Eagle
was made chief. Eagle had flown higher than all the
rest, and had carried Linnet on his back.</p>

<h2>HOW PARTRIDGE GOT HIS WHISTLE</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N THE old days, Terrapin had a fine whistle and
Partridge had none. Terrapin whistled constantly.
He was always boasting of his fine
whistle.</p>

<p>One day Partridge said, &ldquo;Let me try your whistle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Terrapin said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He was afraid Partridge
would try some trick.</p>

<p>Partridge said, &ldquo;Oh, if you are afraid, stay right
here while I use it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Terrapin gave it to him. Partridge strutted
around, whistling constantly.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;How does it sound with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do it very well,&rdquo; said Terrapin, walking by
his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now how do you like it?&rdquo; asked Partridge,
running ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Terrapin, trying to keep up with
him. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t run so fast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you like it now?&rdquo; asked Partridge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
spreading his wings and flying to a tree top. Terrapin
could only look up at him.</p>

<p>Partridge never gave the whistle back. He has it
even to this day. And Terrapin was so ashamed because
Partridge stole his whistle, and Turkey had
stolen his scalp, that he shuts himself up in his box
whenever anyone comes near him.</p>

<h2>HOW KINGFISHER GOT HIS BILL</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>OME of the old men say that Kingfisher was
meant in the beginning to be a water bird, but
because he had no web on his feet and not a good
bill, he could not get enough to eat. The animals
knew of this, so they held a council. Afterwards they
made him a bill like a long, sharp awl. This fish gig
he was to use spearing fish. When they fastened it on
to his mouth, he flew first to the top of a tree. Then he
darted down into the water and came up with a fish on
his bill. And ever since, Kingfisher has been the best
fisherman.</p>

<p>But some of the old people say it was this way.</p>

<p>Blacksnake found Yellowhammer&rsquo;s nest in the hollow
tree and killed all the young birds. Yellowhammer
at once went to the Little People for help. They
sent her to Kingfisher. So she went on to him.</p>

<p>Kingfisher came at once, and after flying back and
forth past the hole in the hollow tree, he made a quick
dart at the snake and pulled him out, dead. When
they looked, they saw he had pierced Blacksnake with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
a slender fish he carried in his bill. Therefore the
Little People said he would make good use of a spear,
so they gave him his long bill.</p>

<h2>WHY THE BLACKBIRD HAS
RED WINGS</h2>

<p class="nation">Chitimacha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day an Indian became so angry with everyone
that he set the sea marshes on fire because
he wanted to burn up the world.</p>

<p>A little blackbird saw it. He flew up into a tree
and shouted, &ldquo;<i>Ku nam wi cu! Ku nam wi cu!</i> The
world and all is going to burn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man said, &ldquo;If you do not go away, I will kill
you.&rdquo; But the bird only kept shouting, &ldquo;<i>Ku nam wi
cu!</i> The world and all is going to burn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Indian threw a shell and hit the little bird
on the wings, making them bleed. That is how the
red-winged blackbird came by its red wings.</p>

<p>Now when people saw the marshes burning, they
quickly ran down and killed game which had been
driven from it by the fire. Then they said to the angry
man,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you put fire in those tall weeds, the deer
and bear and other animals have been driven out and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
we have killed them. You have aided us by burning
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nowadays when the red-winged blackbird comes
around the house, he still shouts, <i>Ku nam wi cu</i>, so
they say.</p>

<h2>BALL GAME OF THE BIRDS AND
ANIMALS</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE the Animals challenged the Birds to a
great ball play, and the Birds accepted. The
Animals met near the river, in a smooth grassy
field. The Birds met in the tree top over by the ridge.</p>

<p>Now the leader of the Animals was Bear. He was
very strong and heavy. All the way to the river he
tossed up big logs to show his strength and boasted of
how he would win against the Birds. Terrapin was
with the Animals. He was not the little terrapin we
have now, but the first Terrapin. His shell was so
hard the heaviest blows could not hurt him, and he
was very large. On the way to the river he rose on
his hind feet and dropped heavily again. He did this
many times, bragging that thus he would crush any
bird that tried to take the ball from him. Then there
was Deer, who could outrun all the others. And there
were many other animals.</p>

<p>Now the leader of the Birds was Eagle; and also
Hawk, and the great Tlanuwa. They were all swift
and strong of flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
Now first they had a ball dance. Then after the
dance, as the birds sat in the trees, two tiny little animals
no larger than field mice climbed up the tree
where Eagle sat. They crept out to the branch tips
to Eagle.</p>

<p>They said, &ldquo;We wish to play ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eagle looked at them. They were four-footed. He
said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you join the Animals? You belong
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Animals make fun of us,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;They
drive us away because we are small.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eagle pitied them. He said, &ldquo;But you have no
wings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then at once Eagle and Hawk and all the Birds
held a council in the trees. At last they said to the
little fellows, &ldquo;We will make wings for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But they could not think just how to do it. Then a
Bird said, &ldquo;The head of our drum is made of groundhog
skin. Let us make wings from that.&rdquo; So they
took two pieces of leather from the drum and shaped
them for wings. They stretched them with cane
splints and fastened them on the forelegs of one of the
little animals. So they made Tlameha, the Bat. They
began to teach him.</p>

<p>First they threw the ball to him. Bat dropped and
circled about in the air on his new wings. He did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
let the ball drop. The Birds saw at once he would
be one of their best men.</p>

<p>Now they wished to give wings also to the second
little animal, but there was no more leather. And
there was no more time. Then somebody said they
might make wings for the other man by stretching his
skin. Therefore two large birds took hold from opposite
sides with their strong bills. Thus they stretched
his skin. Thus they made Tewa, the Flying Squirrel.</p>

<p>Then Eagle threw to him the ball. At once Flying
Squirrel sprang after it, caught it in his teeth, and
carried it through the air to another tree nearby.</p>

<p>Then the game began. Almost at the first toss, Flying
Squirrel caught the ball and carried it up a tree.
Then he threw it to the Birds, who kept it in the air
for some time. When it dropped to the earth, Bear
rushed to get it, but Martin darted after it and threw
it to Bat, who was flying near the ground. Bat doubled
and dodged with the ball, and kept it out of the way of
Deer. At last Bat threw it between the posts. So the
Birds won the game.</p>

<p>Bear and Terrapin, who had boasted of what they
would do, never had a chance to touch the ball.</p>

<p>Because Martin saved the ball when it dropped to
the ground, the Birds afterwards gave him a gourd in
which to build his nest. He still has it.</p>

<h2>WHY THE BIRDS HAVE SHARP
TAILS</h2>

<p class="nation">Biloxi</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time, they say, the world turned
over. Then the waters rose very high and
many people died. A woman took two children
and lodged in a tree. She sat there waiting for
the waters to sink, for she had no way of reaching the
ground.</p>

<p>When the woman saw the Ancient of Red-headed
Buzzards, she called to him, &ldquo;Help me to get down
and I will give you one of the children.&rdquo; He assisted
her, but she did not give him the child.</p>

<p>The waters were so deep that the birds were clinging
by their claws to the clouds, but their tails were
under water. That is why their tails are always sharp.
One of these birds was the Ancient of Yellowhammers.
Therefore its tailfeathers are sharp at the ends. The
large Red-headed Woodpecker was there, too, and the
Ivory-billed Woodpecker, and that is why their tails
have their present shape.</p>

<h2>THE WILDCAT AND THE TURKEYS</h2>

<p class="nation">Biloxi</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Ancient of Wildcats had been creeping
up on the Wild Turkeys trying to catch some.
He tried in vain. Then he got a bag, crawled
inside, and rolled himself along. He rolled himself to
the Ancient of Turkey Gobblers.</p>

<p>Wildcat said, &ldquo;Get into my bag and see what fun
it is to roll.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ancient of Turkey Gobblers crawled into the
bag. Wildcat tied up the end and rolled it along for
some time. After he had rolled it quite a distance, he
stopped and untied the bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very good,&rdquo; said the First of All the Turkey
Gobblers. Then he said to the other Wild Turkeys,
&ldquo;Get in the bag and see how pleasant it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the young Turkeys were afraid. Gobbler urged
them to try the new game. At last one young Turkey
stepped into the bag. Wildcat tied the end and pretended
that he was going to roll it. It would not go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will not go because it is too light. There is only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
one in it,&rdquo; said Wildcat. &ldquo;Let another young Turkey
step in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last another young Turkey stepped in. Wildcat
tied the bag, threw it over his shoulder and ran home.
When he reached home he laid the bag down.</p>

<p>Then Wildcat said to his mother, &ldquo;I have brought
home something on my back, and placed it outside.
Beware lest you untie the bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mother said to herself, &ldquo;I wonder what it can
be.&rdquo; So she untied the bag. One of the turkeys flew
out. She managed to catch the other one. She caught
both feet with one hand, and both wings with the
other. She cried out, &ldquo;Help! Help! I have caught
four!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ancient of Wildcats scolded his mother. Then
he killed the turkey and cooked it. His mother went
into another room.</p>

<p>Then Wildcat spread his feast. As he was eating
the Turkey he made a constant noise. He walked
back and forth. He talked continually and kept up a
steady rattling. When he stopped the noise a little he
said, &ldquo;I am going home,&rdquo; as if a guest were speaking.
He said this again and again. He made a noise with
his feet as if people were walking about. He ate all
the turkey except the hip bone.</p>

reached home he cooked them.</p>

<p>When the fish were cooked, ready for the feast, the
Ancient of Otters put some into a very flat dish. But
the Ancient of Brants could not eat from a flat dish.
All he could do was to hit his bill against the dish,
and raise his head as if swallowing something. But
Otter ate rapidly.</p>

<p>Otter said to his guest, &ldquo;Have you eaten enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am satisfied,&rdquo; said Brant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you are not satisfied,&rdquo; said Otter. He took
more fish and placed them in the flat dish, eating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
rapidly as before. Brant could only hit his bill against
the side of the dish.</p>

<p>When the Ancient of Brants was departing, he said
to Otter, &ldquo;Come to see me tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Otter reached the house of the Ancient of
Brants the next day, Brant cried, &ldquo;Halloo! I have
nothing at all to give you to eat! Sit down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Ancient of Brants went fishing, using a
&ldquo;leather vine&rdquo; which he jerked now and then to
straighten it. He caught many fish and took them
home to cook them. When the fish were cooked, they
began to feast. But the Ancient of Brants had put
some into a small round dish. Ancient of Otters could
not get his mouth into the dish. But Brant ate rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you eaten enough?&rdquo; Brant asked, after a
while.</p>

<p>Otter replied, &ldquo;Yes, I am satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said the Ancient of Brants. &ldquo;How
could you possibly be satisfied! I have served you as
you served me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this ended their friendship.</p>

<h2>THE TINY FROG AND THE PANTHER</h2>

<p class="nation">Biloxi</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Ancient of Tiny Frogs<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> was shut up by
his grandmother, so that he might learn
magic. Then she took him on a journey.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_24_24">[24]</a></span>
The tiny frog, called p&eacute;ska, is a black one, not more than an inch
long, living in muddy streams in Louisiana. It differs from the bullfrog,
common frog, and tree frog.</p>
</div>

<p>First they met the Ancient of Panthers. The grandmother
said to him, &ldquo;This is your sister&rsquo;s son. Look
at him and wrestle with him.&rdquo; The Ancient of Panthers
was very brave. To show his strength, he climbed
very high up a tree which he tore to pieces, falling to
the ground with it.</p>

<p>Then he seized the Ancient of Tiny Frogs. But the
frog caught him by the hind legs and whipped him
against a tree. He beat him so severely that Panther&rsquo;s
jaw was broken in many places. That is why all
panthers have a short jaw.</p>

<p>The Ancient of Tiny Frogs and his grandmother
continued their journey. Next they met Bear. The
grandmother said to him, &ldquo;Look at your sister&rsquo;s son.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
Go and wrestle with him.&rdquo; Bear began to pull the
limbs off a tree to show his strength. Soon he rushed
upon the Ancient of Tiny Frogs. But that one caught
Bear by the hind legs and beat him against a tree until
he broke off short his tail. That is why bears have such
very short tails.</p>

<p>Again the old grandmother, singing as she walked,
went along the trail with her grandson. They met
Buffalo. She said, &ldquo;Look at your sister&rsquo;s son. Go and
wrestle with him.&rdquo; Now Buffalo was very strong.
With his horns he uprooted a tree, and then spent some
moments in breaking it to pieces. Then he rushed at
the Ancient of Tiny Frogs. But that one caught Buffalo
by the hind legs and beat him against a tree. He
beat him until the back of his neck was broken and he
had a great hump on his shoulders. So Buffalo went
away, but that is why buffaloes have such very heavy,
humpbacked shoulders.</p>

<p>Again they walked along the trail, singing. It was
not long before they met with Deer. To him the
grandmother said, &ldquo;Look at your sister&rsquo;s son. Go and
wrestle with him.&rdquo; Deer leaped up to show his agility.
Then he sprang at the Ancient of Tiny Frogs. But
that one seized him by the legs and beat him against a
tree, breaking his nose, and leaving him with a very
small nose, even as deer today have small noses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
Then the Ancient of Tiny Frogs said to Deer: &ldquo;I
shall remain here under the leaves. When hunters are
after you and have almost reached you, I will urge you
to escape by saying, &lsquo;<i>P&eacute;s! P&eacute;s!</i>&rsquo; When I say that, do
your best to get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly had he finished speaking, when he cried out,
&ldquo;<i>P&eacute;s! P&eacute;s!</i> It is so! Go quickly! Do your best!&rdquo;
Then Deer leaped away. For just then the hunters
had come, sure enough.</p>

<p>Therefore, when a tiny frog cries out now, people
say that some one is on the point of running after a
deer.</p>

<h2>THE FRIGHTENER OF HUNTERS</h2>

<p class="nation">Choctaw (Bayou Lacomb)</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">K</span>ASHEHOTAPALO is the frightener of
hunters. His head is small and dried up, like
an old man&rsquo;s. His legs and feet are like those
of a deer. He lives in low, swampy places, far away
from men.</p>

<p>If the hunters come near him, when they are chasing
a deer, he slips up behind them and calls loudly. Thus
he frightens them away. His voice is like that of a
woman. His name means &ldquo;the woman call.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE HUNTER AND THE ALLIGATOR</h2>

<p class="nation">Choctaw (Bayou Lacomb)</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>LL the hunters in a village killed many deer one
winter, except one man. This one saw many
deer. Sometimes he drew his bow and shot at
them; yet they escaped.</p>

<p>Now this hunter had been away from his village
three days. He had seen many deer; not one had he
killed. On the third day, when the sun was hot over
his head, he saw an alligator.</p>

<p>Alligator was in a dry, sandy spot. He had had no
water for many days. He was dry and shriveled.</p>

<p>Alligator said to the hunter, &ldquo;Where can water be
found?&rdquo; The hunter said, &ldquo;In that forest, not far
away, is cold water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot go there alone,&rdquo; said Alligator. &ldquo;Come
nearer. Do not fear.&rdquo; The hunter went nearer, but he
was afraid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a hunter,&rdquo; said Alligator, &ldquo;but all the
deer escape you. Carry me into the water, and I will
make you a great hunter. You shall kill many deer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hunter was still afraid. Then he said, &ldquo;I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
carry you, but first I must bind you so that you cannot
scratch me; and your mouth, so that you cannot
bite me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Alligator rolled over on his back and let the
hunter bind him. He fastened his legs and mouth
firmly. Then he carried Alligator on his shoulders to
the water in the forest. He unfastened the cords and
threw him in.</p>

<p>Alligator came to the surface three times. He said,
&ldquo;Take your bow and arrow and go into the woods.
You will find a small doe. Do not kill it. Then you
will find a large doe. Do not kill it. You will meet
a small buck. Do not kill that. Then you will meet a
large, old buck. Kill that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hunter took his bow and arrow. Everything
happened just as Alligator had foretold. Then he
killed the large, old buck. So he became a very great
hunter. There was always venison in his wigwam.</p>

<h2>THE GROUNDHOG DANCE</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>EVEN wolves once caught a groundhog. They
said, &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll kill you and have something
to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Groundhog said, &ldquo;When we find good food, we
should rejoice over it, as people do in the green-corn
dances. You will kill me, and I cannot help myself.
But if you want to dance, I&rsquo;ll sing for you. Now this
is a new dance. I will lean up against seven trees in
turn. You will dance forward and then go back. At
the last turn you may kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the Wolves were very hungry, but they wanted
to learn the new dance. Groundhog leaned up against
a tree and began to sing. He sang,</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ho wi ye a hi</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and all the Wolves danced forward. When he shouted
&ldquo;<i>Yu!</i>&rdquo; they turned and danced back in line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Groundhog, after the first dance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
was over. Then he went to the next tree and began
the second song. He sang,</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Hi ya yu we</i>,<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and the Wolves danced forward. When he shouted
&ldquo;<i>Yu!</i>&rdquo; they danced back in a straight line.</p>

<p>At each song, Groundhog took another tree, getting
closer and closer to his hole under a stump. At the
seventh song, Groundhog said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now this is the last dance. When I shout &lsquo;<i>Yu!</i>&rsquo;
all come after me. The one who gets me may
have me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he sang a long time, until the Wolves were at
quite a distance in a straight line. Then he shouted
&ldquo;<i>Yu!</i>&rdquo; and darted for his hole.</p>

<p>At once the Wolves turned and were after him. The
foremost Wolf caught his tail and gave it such a jerk
he broke it off. That is why Groundhog has such a
short tail.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day Racoon went into the woods to fast and
dream. He dreamed that someone said to him,
&ldquo;When you awaken, paint your face and body

been told to do. So we see him, even to the present day.</p>

<h2>WHY THE OPOSSUM PLAYS DEAD</h2>

<p class="nation">Biloxi</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Ancient of Opossums thought that he
would reach a certain pond very early in the
morning, so that he might catch the crawfish
on the shore. But someone else reached there first,
and when Opossum reached there the crawfish were
all gone.</p>

<p>This person did this every day. Opossum did not
know who it was, so he lay in wait for him. He found
it was the Ancient of Racoons.</p>

<p>They argued about the crawfish and the pond. They
agreed to see which could rise the earlier in the morning,
go around the shore of the pond and catch the
crawfish.</p>

<p>Racoon said, &ldquo;I rise very early. I never sleep until
daylight comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Opossum said the same thing. Then each went
home.</p>

<p>Now Opossum lay down in a hollow tree and slept
there a long time. He arose when the sun was very
high and went to the pond. But Racoon had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
there ahead of him, and had eaten all the crawfish.
Racoon sang the Song of the Racoon as he was going
home. Opossum stood listening. He, too, sang. He
sang the Song of the Opossum, thus:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>H&iacute; na <span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span> k&iacute;-yu <span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span> wus-s&eacute;-di</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He met the Racoon who had eaten all the crawfish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Racoon. &ldquo;I have been eating very
long, and I was going home, as I was sleepy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Opossum said, &ldquo;I, too, have been eating so long that
I am sleepy, so I am going home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Opossum was always telling a lie. People say this
of the Opossum because if one hits that animal and
throws it down for dead, soon it gets up and walks off.</p>

<h2>WHY THE &rsquo;POSSUM&rsquo;S TAIL IS BARE</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>OSSUM used to have a long, bushy tail and he
was so proud of it that he combed it out every
morning and sang about it at the dance. Now
Rabbit had had no tail since Bear pulled it off because
he was jealous. Therefore he planned to play a trick
on &rsquo;Possum.</p>

<p>The animals called a great council. They planned
to have a dance. It was Rabbit&rsquo;s business to send out
the news. One day as he was passing &rsquo;Possum&rsquo;s house,
he stopped to talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to the council?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if I can have a special seat,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Possum.
&ldquo;I have such a handsome tail I ought to sit where
everyone can see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rabbit said, &ldquo;I will see that you have a special seat.
And I will send someone to comb your tail for the
dance.&rdquo; &rsquo;Possum was very much pleased.</p>

<p>Rabbit at once went to Cricket, who is an expert hair
cutter; therefore the Indians call him the barber. He
told Cricket to go the next morning and comb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
&rsquo;Possum&rsquo;s tail for the dance. He told Cricket just what
to do.</p>

<p>In the morning, Cricket went to &rsquo;Possum&rsquo;s house.
&rsquo;Possum stretched himself out on the floor and went to
sleep, while Cricket combed out his tail and wrapped
a red string around it to keep it smooth until night.
But all the time, as he wound the string around, he was
snipping off the hair closely. &rsquo;Possum did not know it.</p>

<p>When it was night, &rsquo;Possum went to the council and
took his special seat. When it was his turn to dance,
he loosened the red string from his tail and stepped
into the middle of the lodge.</p>

<p>The drummers began to beat the drum. &rsquo;Possum
began to sing, &ldquo;See my beautiful tail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every man shouted and &rsquo;Possum danced around the
circle again, singing, &ldquo;See what a fine color it has.&rdquo;
They all shouted again, and &rsquo;Possum went on dancing,
as he sang, &ldquo;See how it sweeps the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the animals all shouted so that &rsquo;Possum wondered
what it meant. He looked around. Every man
was laughing at him. Then he looked down at his
beautiful tail. It was as bare as a lizard&rsquo;s tail. There
was not a hair on it.</p>

<p>He was so astonished and ashamed that he could not
say a word. He rolled over on the ground and grinned,
just as he does today when taken by surprise.</p>

<h2>WHY &rsquo;POSSUM HAS A LARGE MOUTH</h2>

<p class="nation">Choctaw (Bayou Lacomb)</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">V</span>ERY little food there was for Deer one dry
season. He became thin and weak. One day
he met &rsquo;Possum. Deer at once exclaimed,
&ldquo;Why, &rsquo;Possum, how fat you are! How do you keep
so fat when I cannot find enough to eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rsquo;Possum said, &ldquo;I live on persimmons. They are
very large this year, so I have all I want to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you get the persimmons?&rdquo; asked Deer.
&ldquo;They grow so high!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is easy,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Possum. &ldquo;I go to the top of a
high hill. Then I run down and strike a persimmon
tree so hard with my head that all the ripe persimmons
drop on the ground. Then I sit there and eat them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is easily done,&rdquo; said Deer. &ldquo;I will try it.
Now watch me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rsquo;Possum waited. Deer went to the top of a nearby
hill. He ran down and struck the tree with his head.
&rsquo;Possum watched him, laughing. He opened his
mouth so wide while he laughed that he stretched it.
That is why &rsquo;Possum has such a large mouth.</p>

<h2>THE PORCUPINE AND THE TWO SISTERS</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE there dwelt in a village two sisters, who
were the swiftest runners in the Menomini
tribe. Towards the setting sun was another
village, two days&rsquo; walk away.</p>

<p>The sisters wished to visit this village. They began
to run at great speed. At noon they came to a hollow
tree lying across the trail. In the snow on the ground,
there, behold! lay the trail of Porcupine, leading to the
hollow tree. One of them broke off a stick and began
to poke into the log, that Porcupine might come out.
She said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have some fun with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other sister, &ldquo;he is a manido. We
should leave him alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the girl with a stick poked into the hollow log
until Porcupine came out. Then she caught him and
pulled out his long quills and threw them in the snow.
The other said, &ldquo;No, it is cold. Porcupine will need
his robe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last the sisters ran on. The village was still far
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
Now when they left Porcupine, he crawled up a
tall pine tree until he reached the very top. Then he
faced the north and began to shake his small rattle,
singing in time to its sound.</p>

<p>Soon the sky darkened. Snow began to fall. Now
the sisters could not run rapidly because of the deepening snow.</p>

<p>One looked back and saw Porcupine in the tree top,
shaking his rattle. She said, &ldquo;We must go back to our
own village. I am afraid some harm will overtake us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other answered, &ldquo;No, let us go on. We need
not fear Porcupine.&rdquo; The snow became deeper, so
they rolled up their blankets as they ran on.</p>

<p>When the sun followed the trail over the edge of the
world, the sisters could not even see the village. Still
they ran on. Then in the late evening they came to a
stream which they knew was near the village.</p>

<p>Behold! It was dark. The snow was very deep.
The sisters no longer had strength. They could hear
voices in the village. They could not call loud enough
to be heard. Thus they perished in the snow.</p>

<p>One should never harm Porcupine because he is a
manido.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE when the Catfish were all together in one
place in the water, the Catfish chief said, &ldquo;I
have often seen a moose come to the edge of
the water to eat grass. Let us watch for him and kill
him and eat him. He always comes when the sun is a
little way up in the sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Catfish agreed to attack Moose. So they went
to watch. They crept everywhere in among the grass
and rushes when Moose came down to the water&rsquo;s edge,
slowly picking at the grass. All the tribe watched to
see what the Catfish chief would do. He slipped
slowly through the marshy grass to where Moose was
standing. He thrust his spear into Moose&rsquo;s leg.</p>

<p>Moose said, &ldquo;Who has thrust a spear into my leg?&rdquo;
He looked down and saw the Catfish tribe. At once
he began to trample upon them with his hoofs. He
killed many, but others escaped and swam down the
river.</p>

<p>Catfish still carry spears, but their heads are flat,
because Moose tramped them down in the mud.</p>

<h2>TURTLE</h2>

<p class="nation">Menomini</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was a large camp in which Miqkano,
the Turtle, took up his abode. He built a
wigwam but he had no one to keep house for
him. He thought he needed a wife.</p>

<p>Now Turtle found a young woman whom he liked.
He said, &ldquo;I want you to be my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;How are you going to provide for me?
You cannot keep up with the rest of the people when
they move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turtle replied, &ldquo;I can keep up with the best of your
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the young woman wanted to put him off. She
said, &ldquo;Oh, well, I will marry you in the spring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turtle was vexed with this. At last he said, &ldquo;I shall
go to war and take some captives. When I return in
the spring, I shall expect you to marry me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Turtle prepared to go on the war path. He
called all his friends, the Turtles, to him. He left
camp, followed by a throng of curious Indians. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
young woman he wanted to marry laughed as the
Turtles moved away. They were so very slow.</p>

<p>Turtle was vexed again. He said, &ldquo;In four days
from now you will surely mourn for me because I shall
be at a great distance from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the girl, laughing, &ldquo;in four days from
this time you will scarcely be out of sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turtle immediately corrected himself, and said, &ldquo;I
did not mean four days, but four years. Then I shall
return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the Turtles started off. They traveled slowly
on until one day they found a great tree lying across
their trail.</p>

<p>Turtle said, &ldquo;This we cannot pass unless we go
around it. That would take too long. What shall
we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some said, &ldquo;Let us burn a hole through the trunk,&rdquo;
but in this they did not succeed.</p>

<p>Therefore they had to turn back home, but it was a
long time before they came near the Indian village
again. They wanted to appear as successful warriors,
so as they came near, they set up the war song. The
Indians heard them. They at once ran out to see the
scalps and the spoils. But when they came near, the
Turtles each seized an Indian by the arm and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We take you our prisoners. You are our spoils.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
The Indians who were captured in this way were
very angry. Now the Turtle chief had captured the
young woman he said he was going to marry. He said
to the Indian girl, &ldquo;Now that I have you I will keep
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now it was necessary to organize a dance to celebrate
the victory over the Indians. Everyone dressed
in his best robe and beads. Turtle sang,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever comes near me will die, will die,
will die!&rdquo; and the others danced around him in a
circle. At once the Indians became alarmed. Each
one fled to his own lodge, in the village. Turtle also
went to the village, but he arrived much later because
he could not travel so fast.</p>

<p>Someone said to him, &ldquo;That girl has married
another man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; stormed Turtle. &ldquo;Let me see the
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he went to that wigwam. He called, &ldquo;I am
going for the woman who promised to be my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her husband said, &ldquo;Here comes Turtle. Now what
is to be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall take care of that,&rdquo; said his wife.</p>

<p>Turtle came in and seized her. He said, &ldquo;Come
along with me. You belong to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pulled back. She said, &ldquo;You broke your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
promise.&rdquo; The husband said also, &ldquo;Yes, you promised
to go to war and bring back some prisoners. You failed
to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turtle said, &ldquo;I did go. I returned with many prisoners.&rdquo;
Then he picked up the young woman and
carried her off.</p>

<p>Now when Turtle arrived at his own wigwam, the
young woman went at once to a friend and borrowed
a large kettle. She filled it with water and set it on
to boil. Turtle became afraid. He said, &ldquo;What are
you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;I am heating some water. Do you know
how to swim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Turtle. &ldquo;I can swim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young woman said, &ldquo;You jump in the water
and swim. I can wash your shell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Turtle tried to swim in the hot water. Then the
other Turtles, seeing their chief swimming in the
kettle, climbed over the edge and jumped into the
water. Thus Turtle and his warriors were conquered.</p>

<h2>THE WORSHIP OF THE SUN</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ONG ago, an Ojibwa Indian and his wife lived
on the shores of Lake Huron. They had one
son, who was named &ldquo;O-na-wut-a-qui-o, He-that-catches-the-clouds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the boy was very handsome, and his parents
thought highly of him, but he refused to make the
fast of his tribe. His father gave him charcoal; yet he
would not blacken his face. They refused him food;
but he wandered along the shore, and ate the eggs of
birds. One day his father took from him by force the
eggs of the birds. He took them violently. Then he
threw charcoal to him. Then did the boy blacken his
face and begin his fast.</p>

<p>Now he fell asleep. A beautiful woman came down
through the air and stood beside him. She said, &ldquo;I
have come for you. Step in my trail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At once he began to rise through the air. They
passed through an opening in the sky, and he found
himself on the Sky-plain. There were flowers on the
beautiful plain, and streams of fresh, cold water. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
valleys were green and fair. Birds were singing. The
Sky-land was very beautiful.</p>

<p>There was but one lodge, and it was divided into
two parts. In one end were bright and glowing robes,
spears, and bows and arrows. At the other end, the
garments of a woman were hung.</p>

<p>The woman said, &ldquo;My brother is coming and I must
hide you.&rdquo; So she put him in a corner and spread
over him a broad, shining belt. When the brother
came in, he was very richly dressed, and glowing. He
took down his great pipe and his tobacco.</p>

<p>At last, he said, &ldquo;Nemissa, my elder sister, when
will you end these doings? The Greatest of Spirits
has commanded that you should not take away the
children of earth. I know of the coming of O-na-wut-a-qui-o.&rdquo;
Then he called out, &ldquo;Come out of your
hiding. You will get hungry if you remain there.&rdquo;
When the boy came out, he gave him a handsome pipe
of red sandstone, and a bow and arrows.</p>

<p>So the boy stayed in the Sky-land. But soon he
found that every morning, very early, the brother left
the wigwam. He returned in the evening, and then
the sister left it and was gone all night. One day he
said to the brother, &ldquo;Let me go with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said the brother, and the next morning they started off.</p>

<p>The two traveled a long while over a smooth plain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
It was a very long journey. He became hungry. At
last he said, &ldquo;Is there no game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until we reach the place where I always stop
to eat,&rdquo; said the brother. So they journeyed on. At
last they came to a place spread over with fine mats.
It was near a hole in the Sky-plain.</p>

<p>The Indian looked down through the hole. Below
were great lakes and the villages of his people. He
could see in one place feasting and dancing, and in
another a war party silently stealing upon the enemy.
In a green plain young warriors were playing ball.</p>

<p>The brother said, &ldquo;Do you see those children?&rdquo; and
he sent a dart down from the Sky-plain. At once a
little boy fell to the ground. Then all the people
gathered about the lodge of his father. The Indian,
looking down through the hole, could hear the <i>she-she-gwan</i>
of the <i>meta</i>, and the loud singing. Then Sun,
the brother, called down, &ldquo;Send me up a white dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately a white dog was killed by the medicine
men, and roasted, because the child&rsquo;s father ordered a
feast. All the wise men and the medicine men were
there.</p>

<p>Sun said to the Indian, &ldquo;Their ears are open and
they listen to my voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the Indians on the Earth-plain divided the dog,
and placed pieces on the bark for those who were at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
that feast. Then the master of the feast called up,
&ldquo;We send this to thee, Great Manito.&rdquo; At once the
roasted dog came up to Sun in the Sky-plain. Thus
Sun and the Indian had food. Then Sun healed the
boy whom he had struck down. Then he began again
to travel along the trail in the Sky-plain, and they
reached their wigwam by another road.</p>

<p>Then O-na-wut-a-qui-o began to weary of the Sky-land.
At last he said to Moon, &ldquo;I wish to go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moon said, &ldquo;Since you like better the care and
poverty of the earth, you may return. I will take you
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At once the Indian youth awoke. He was in the
very plain where he had fallen asleep after he had
blackened his face and begun his fast. But his mother
said he had been gone a year.</p>

<h2>TASHKA AND WALO</h2>

<p class="nation">Choctaw (Bayou Lacomb)</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ASHKA and Walo were brothers. They lived
a long while ago, so they say. Every morning
they saw Sun come up over the edge of the
earth. Then he followed the trail through the sky.</p>

<p>When they were four years old, they started to
follow Sun&rsquo;s trail. They walked all day, but that night
when Sun died, they were still in their own country.
They knew all the hills and rivers. Then they slept.</p>

<p>Next morning they began again to follow Sun, but
when he died at the edge of the earth, they could still
see their own land.</p>

<p>Then they followed Sun many years. At last they
became grown men.</p>

<p>One day they reached a great sea-water. There was
no land except the shore on which they stood. When
Sun went down over the edge of the earth that day,
they saw him sink into the waters. Then they crossed
the sea-water, to the edge. So they came to Sun&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p>All around there were many women. The stars are
women, and Moon also. Moon is Sun&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
Moon asked them how they had found their way.
They were very far from their own land. They said,
&ldquo;For many years we have followed Sun&rsquo;s trail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sun said, &ldquo;Do you know your way home?&rdquo; They
said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; So Sun took them up to the edge of the
water. They could see the earth, but they could not
see their own land.</p>

<p>Sun asked, &ldquo;Why did you follow me?&rdquo; They said,
&ldquo;We wished to see where you lived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sun said, &ldquo;I will send you home. But for four days
you must not speak a word to any person. If you do
not speak, you shall live long. You shall have much
wealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Sun called to Buzzard. He put the two
brothers on Buzzard&rsquo;s back. He said, &ldquo;Take them
back to earth.&rdquo; So Buzzard started for the earth.</p>

<p>Now the clouds are halfway between heaven and
earth. The wind never blows above the clouds, so
they say.</p>

<p>Buzzard flew from heaven to the clouds. The
brothers could easily keep their hold. Then Buzzard
flew from the clouds to the earth. But now Wind blew
them in all directions. Then at last they came to earth.
They saw the trees around their own village. They
rested under the trees. An old man passing by knew
them. So he went down the trail and told their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
mother. She at once hastened to see them. When she
met them, she began to talk. She made them talk to
her. They told her. So they spoke before the four
days were ended. Therefore Sun could not keep his
promise.</p>

One day Sun dressed himself to go hunting, took his
bows and arrows, and left. He was gone a long time.
When he did not return, his sister became frightened,
and came out into the sky to look for her brother. At
last he returned, bringing with him a bear which he
had shot.</p>

<p>Moon still comes up into the sky and travels for
twenty days. Then she disappears, and for four days
nothing is seen of her. At the end of the four days, she
comes into the sky again, and travels twenty days more.</p>

<p>Sun is a being like ourselves. He wears an otter
skin about his head.</p>

night came he disappeared. He went up above. He
stays up above all the time now, so they say. Sometimes
he is dressed altogether in a shining robe, and
therefore he is bright at night. But immediately afterwards
he disappears. You can still see the black spot,

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE night hunters in the mountains noticed two
shining lights moving along the top of a
distant ridge. After a while the lights vanished
on the other side. Thus they watched many
nights, talking around the camp fire.</p>

<p>One morning they traveled to the ridge. Then they
searched long. At last they found two round creatures
covered with soft fur or downy feathers. They had
small heads.</p>

<p>Then the hunters took these strange creatures to their
camp. They watched them. In the day, they were
only balls of gray fur; only when the breeze stirred
their fur, then sparks flew out. At night they grew
bright and shone like stars.</p>

<p>They kept very quiet. They did not stir, so the
hunters did not fasten them. One night they suddenly
rose from the ground like balls of fire. They went
above the tops of the trees, and then higher until they
reached the Sky-land. So the hunters knew they
were stars.</p>

<h2>THE WEST WIND</h2>

<p class="nation">Chitimacha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> LITTLE boy named Ustapu was one day lying
on the shore of a lake. His people had just
reached the shore from the prairies, but the
wind was too high for them to cross.</p>

<p>As he lay there, he suddenly saw another boy fanning
himself with a fan of turkey wings. This was the boy
who made the West Wind. Ustapu said to his tribe,
&ldquo;I can break the arm of the boy who makes West
Wind.&rdquo; But they laughed at him. He took a shell
and threw it at the boy and struck his left arm.</p>

<p>Therefore when the west wind is high, the Indians
say that the boy is using his strong arm. When the
west wind is a gentle breeze, they say he is using his
injured arm. Before that, the west wind had always
been so strong it was very disagreeable, because Wind-maker
could use both arms. Now it is much gentler.</p>

<p>The Indians think this boy also made the other
winds.</p>

<h2>THE LONE LIGHTNING</h2>

<p class="nation">Ojibwa</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>T ONE time an orphan boy whose uncle was
very unkind to him ran away. He ran a long
way. He ran until night. Then because he
was afraid of wild animals, he climbed into a tree in
the forest. It was a high pine tree, and he climbed into
the forked branches of it.</p>

<p>A person came to him from the upper sky. He said,
&ldquo;Follow me. Step in my trail. I have seen how
badly you are treated.&rdquo; Then at once as the boy
stepped in his trail, he rose higher and higher into the
upper sky. Then the person put twelve arrows into
his hands. He said, &ldquo;There are evil manitoes in the
sky. Go to war against them. Shoot them with your
bow and arrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy went into the northern part of the upper
sky. Soon he saw a manito and shot at him. But that
one&rsquo;s magic was too strong. Therefore the shot failed.
There was only a single streak of lightning in the
northern sky, yet there was no storm, and not even a
cloud.</p>

Eleven times the boy thus failed to kill a manito, and
thus he had but one arrow left. He held this in his
hands a long while, looking around. Now these evil
manitoes had very strong medicine. They could
change their form in a moment. But they feared the
boy&rsquo;s arrows because they were also strong magic. And
because they had been given to him by a good manito,
they had power to kill.</p>

<p>At last the boy saw the chief of the evil manitoes.
He drew his bow and shot his last arrow; but the chief
saw it coming. At once he changed himself into a rock.
And the arrow buried itself in a crack of the rock.
The chief was very angry. He cried, &ldquo;Now your
arrows are all gone! And because you have dared to
shoot at me, you shall become the trail of your arrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus at once he changed the boy into Nazhik-a-wawa,
the Lone Lightning.</p>

<h2>WHY THE OAKS AND SUMACHS REDDEN</h2>

<p class="nation">Fox</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE on a time, long ago, when it was winter,
so they say, it snowed for the first time. And
while the very first snow lay on the ground,
so they say, three men went early in the morning to
hunt for game.</p>

<p>In a thick growth of shrub on a side hill, a bear had
entered in. They could see the trail in the snow. One
went in after him, and started him going in flight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Away from The-place-whence-comes-the-cold he
is making fast!&rdquo; he called to the others.</p>

<p>But the one who had gone round by way of The-place-from-whence-comes-the-cold,
cried, &ldquo;In the
direction From-whence-comes-the-source-of-midday is
he hurrying away.&rdquo; Thus he said.</p>

<p>The third, who had gone round by way of The-place-whence-comes-the-source-of-midday,
cried out,
&ldquo;Towards-the-place-where-the-sun-falls-down is he
hastening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Back and forth for a long while did they keep the
bear fleeing from one to another. After a while, one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
the hunters who was coming behind looked down.
Behold! The earth below was green. For it is really
true, so they say, that up into the Sky-land were they
led away by the bear. While they were chasing him
about the dense growth of shrubs, that was surely the
time that up into the Sky-land they went.</p>

<p>Then quickly he called, &ldquo;Oh, Union-of-rivers, let us
turn back. Truly into the Sky-land is he leading us
away.&rdquo; So he called to Union-of-rivers, but no
answer did he receive from that one.</p>

<p>Now Union-of-rivers, who went running between
the man ahead and the man behind, had a little puppy,
Hold-tight.</p>

<p>Now in the autumn, they overtook the bear. Then
they slew him. After they had slain him, many boughs
of an oak did they cut, also of sumach. So with the
bear lying on top of the boughs, they skinned him, and
cut up the meat. Then they began to scatter the pieces
in all directions.</p>

<p>Towards The-place-whence-comes-the-dawn-of-day
they hurled the head. In winter, when dawn is nearly
breaking, stars appear which are that head, so they say.</p>

<p>Also to the east flung they his backbone. In winter
time, certain stars lie close together. These are the
backbone, so they say.</p>

<p>And it has also been told of the bear and the hunters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
that the group of four stars in front are the bear and
the three hunters. And between the front star and the
star behind, a tiny little star hangs. That is the little
dog, Hold-tight, which was the pet of Union-of-rivers.</p>

<p>And so often as autumn comes, the oaks and sumachs
redden at the leaf because their boughs were stained
with the blood of the bear.</p>

<h2>THE MAN OF ICE</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE when the people were burning the woods
in the fall, a poplar tree began to burn. It
burned until the fire went down into the roots;
and then down into the ground. It burned and burned
until there was a great hole in the ground, and the
people began to be afraid the whole world would burn.
They tried to put out the fire, but it was too deep in
the ground.</p>

<p>At last someone said, &ldquo;There is a man living in a
house of ice, far toward the Frozen Land. He can put
out the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So messengers were sent. They traveled many
sleeps until they came to the house of the Man of Ice.
He was a little fellow with long braids of hair, hanging
to the ground.</p>

<p>He said at once, &ldquo;Oh, yes, I can help you,&rdquo; and
began to unbraid his hair. When it was all loose, he
took it in one hand and struck the ends against the
other hand. The messengers felt a wind blow against
their cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
He struck the ends of his hair again across his hand.
A light rain began to fall. A third time he struck the
open hand with his hair. Sleet began to fall with the
rain. The fourth time, and large hailstones fell.
They fell as though they came out of the ends of his
hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now go home,&rdquo; said the medicine man. &ldquo;I shall
be there tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the messengers returned. They found the people
standing around the burning hole.</p>

<p>The next day, as the people stood again at the burning
hole, watching the fire, a light wind came from
the north. They were afraid because they knew the
medicine man had sent it. The wind made the flames
sweep higher. Then a light rain began to fall. It but
made the fire hotter. Then came sleet with a heavy
rain, and hail. The flames died down but clouds of
smoke and steam arose.</p>

<p>Then the people fled to their wigwams for shelter.
A great wind arose which blew the hail into the depths
of the fire and piled up a great heap of hailstones.
Then the fire died out and the smoke ceased.</p>

<p>Now when the people went to look again&mdash;a lake
stood where flames had been. Yet from below the
water came the sound of embers still crackling.</p>

<h2>THE NUNNEHI</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Nunnehi are The People Who Live Anywhere.
They were spirit people who lived in
the highlands of the Cherokee country, and
they liked the bald mountain peaks where no timber
ever grows.</p>

<p>No one could see the Nunnehi except when the
spirit-people let themselves be seen, and then they
looked and acted just like other Indians. But they like
music and dancing, and hunters in the mountains often
could hear the dance songs and the drum; yet when
they went towards the sound, it would suddenly shift
behind them or in some other direction. They were a
friendly people, too. Some Indians have thought they
were the same as the Little People; but those are no
larger than little children.</p>

<p>Once a boy was with the Nunnehi. When he was
about ten or twelve years old, he was playing one day
near the river, shooting at a mark with his bow and
arrow. Then he started to build a fish trap in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
water. While he was piling up the stones in two long
walls, a man came and stood on the bank.</p>

<p>The man said, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; The boy
told him. The man said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty hard work.
You ought to rest awhile. Come and take a walk up
the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy said, &ldquo;No. I am going to the lodge to get
something to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to my lodge,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you
good food and bring you home again in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the boy went to the man&rsquo;s lodge with him. They
went up the river. The man&rsquo;s wife and all the other
people were glad to see him. They gave him plenty
to eat. While he was eating, a man that the boy knew
very well indeed came in and spoke to him. So he
did not feel strange.</p>

<p>Afterwards he played with the other children and
slept there that night. In the morning, their father
took him down the trail. They went down a trail that
had a cornfield on one side and a peach orchard on the
other, until they came to a cross trail. Then the man
said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go along this trail across that ridge and you will
come to the river road that will take you straight to
your home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he went back to his house. The boy went down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
the trail, but soon he turned and looked back. There
was no cornfield there; there were no peach trees or
house&mdash;nothing but trees on the mountain side. Still
he was not frightened. He went on until he came to
the river trail in sight of his home. He saw many
people standing about talking. When they saw him,
they ran towards him shouting, &ldquo;Here he is! He is
not drowned or killed in the mountains!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they said, &ldquo;Where have you been? We have
been looking for you ever since yesterday noon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man took me over to his house, just across the
ridge,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;I thought Udsi-skala would
tell you where I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Udsi-skala said, &ldquo;I have not seen you. I was out all
day in my canoe looking for you. It was one of the
Nunnehi who made himself look like me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mother said, &ldquo;You say you had plenty to eat
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no house there,&rdquo; his mother answered.
&ldquo;There is nothing there but trees and rocks, but we
hear a drum sometimes in the big bald peak above.
The people you saw were the Nunnehi.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE PEOPLE</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE is another race of spirits, the Little
People. They live in rock caves and in the
mountain side. They hardly reach to a man&rsquo;s
knee, but they are very handsome, with long hair falling
to the ground. They work wonders, and are fond
of music. They spend half their time drumming and
dancing. If their drum is heard in lonely places in
the mountains, it is not safe to follow it. They do not
like to be disturbed and they throw a spell over people
who annoy them. And even when such a person at
last gets back home, he seems dazed.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Little People come near a house at
night, but even if people hear them talking, they must
not go out. And in the morning, the corn is gathered,
or the field cleared, as if a great many people had been
at work.</p>

<p>When a hunter finds a knife in the woods, he must
say, &ldquo;Little People, I want to take this,&rdquo; because it
may belong to them. Otherwise, they may throw
stones at him as he goes home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
There are other spirits. The Water Dwellers live
in the water and fishermen pray to them.</p>

<p>There are also the hunter spirits who are very handsome.
Sometimes they help the hunters, but when
someone trips and falls, we know one of these hunter
spirits tripped him up.</p>

<p>Then there is Det-sata. Det-sata was once a boy
who ran away from his home. He has a great many
children who are all just like him and have his name.
When a flock of birds flies up suddenly as if frightened,
it is because Det-sata is chasing them. He is mischievous
and sometimes hides an arrow from the bird
hunter who may have shot it off into a perfectly clear
space, but looks and looks without finding it.</p>

<p>Then the hunter says, &ldquo;Det-sata, you have my arrow.
If you do not give it up, I&rsquo;ll scratch you.&rdquo; When he
looks again, he finds it.</p>

<h2>THE WAR MEDICINE</h2>

<p class="nation">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>OME warriors had medicine to change themselves
into any animal or bird they wished.</p>

<p>Long ago, a warrior coming in from the hunt,
found enemies attacking the wigwams of his people
across the river. The men were away hunting. On
the river bank, he found a mussel shell. With his
medicine he changed the shell into a canoe. Thus he
crossed the river, and went to his grandmother&rsquo;s wigwam.
She sat with her head in a blanket, waiting to
be killed. At once he changed her into a small gourd,
and fastened her to his belt. Then he climbed a tree
and became a swamp woodcock. Thus he flew back
across the river. So the warrior and his grandmother
escaped.</p>

<h2>THE COMING OF THE WHITE MAN</h2>

<p class="nation">Wyandot</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>OW in early days, the Wyandots lived about
the St. Lawrence River, in the mountains to
the eastward. They were the first tribe of old.
They had the first chieftainship. The chief said to his
nephews, the Lenap&eacute;es,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go down to the seacoast and look. If you see anything,
come and tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the Lenap&eacute;es had a village by the sea. They
often looked out, but they saw nothing. One day
something came. When it came near the land, it
stopped. Then the people were afraid. They ran into
the woods. The next day two Indians went quietly
to look. It was lying there in the water. Then something
just like it came out of it and walked on two legs
over the water.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> When it came to the land, two men
stepped out of it. They were different from us. They
made signs for the Lenap&eacute;es to come out of the woods.
They gave presents. Then the Lenap&eacute;es gave them
skin clothes.</p>

The white men went away. They came back many
times. They asked the Indians for room to put a chair
on the land. So it was given. But soon they began to
pull the lacing out of the bottom and to walk inland
with it. They have not yet come to the end of the
string.</p>
